ialh84,"TENS unit recommendations?
I've been seeing ads for Ovira and Livia but from the reviews I've read it seems like they're overpriced and no different from a regular TENS unit. So I'd kind of like to try  regular TENS unit, but I'm not sure what to get. There are dozens of products on Amazon and various other retailers, all with a mix of reviews about their effectiveness and overall quality. Anyway, does anyone use a TENS unit for their pelvic pain that they would recommend?",post
iam4l5,"Anyone know where to get quarters?
My apartment laundry is coin-op and I can't get quarters from Wells Fargo because of the shortage. I also tried Walgreens and the most I could get was a dollar, someone else said they were turned down at Smith's. I imagine a laundromat wouldn't take too kindly to me using their change machine if I don't use their service. 

Anyway, does anyone know of any banks that might be willing to exchange coins for a non-member, or has anyone had luck with any stores? 

I would just go to the laundromat to do my laundry but I don't have a car and it'd be a pain in the ass to haul my clothes all the way there on foot. Also don't feel like shelling out $10 for Uber every time I need to do laundry.",post

ioou4c,"Is it dangerous to look at the sun when it's obscured by smoke?
Lately smoke from wildfire in my state has been obscuring the sun and making the sunset look like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/iok69t/albuquerque_sun/). Which is pretty fascinating to witness. But something just occurred to me - is it dangerous to look at the sun even when it's obscured by smoke? 

I mean, it's not safe to look during an eclipse, but during an eclipse part of the sun is still completely exposed. In this case there's a dense layer of smoke blocking out much of the sun's light. 

So yeah, is it safe to look at or should people not be doing that?",post
iozs0z,"What's the point?
I don't understand what the point in sticking around is. The world around me is crumbling. My country, my home, is collapsing. Almost 200k people dead from COVID-19 and counting. Political unrest is reaching a boiling point, or maybe it already has and this is the beginning of the end. The sky is clouded with wildfire smoke and the sun is crimson red. Millions are unemployed, losing their homes, unable to feed their children. Temperatures are rising. The arctic is melting. More and more species on the verge of extinction. 

I haven't touched another human being in 3 months. I can't see my family because it's too dangerous and I don't know when that's going to get better. I miss being hugged. I want someone to hold me. 

And yet everyone around me is continuing to live their lives like they don't see the calamity and destruction happening right in front of their faces. Any optimism feels like gaslighting. 

How much longer do I have to go to work and pretend things are normal? I'm not strong enough to survive when shit *really* hits the fan. I'd rather leave now, while I still have the chance, while it's still easy.

The only thing keeping me here is that I want to vote. Come October, I need to cast my vote. Even if it ends up being worthless. After that, I can't make any promises that I'll be sticking around.",post

iusum0,"My sister's dog has lymphoma
Her name is Asgard. She's a black lab. The sweetest pup I've ever met. She loves everyone and all she wants is snuggle and get petted. 

During the beginning of the pandemic I went to stay with my sister. It was supposed to be a short trip but then everything got scary so we decided it would be best for me to just stay put. I was there for 3 months. 

It was one of the hardest times I've ever been through. I lived with constant, crushing anxiety and dread. I had suicidal thoughts. There were days I didn't want to get up at all. 

But Asgard did not give me a choice. She was there every morning, sniffing my face and nudging me with her cold nose, staring at me wide-eyed until I got up. For 3 months she gave me something to cling to. Everything else in the world was shit, but I had my family, and I had this sweet dog who loved me like she'd known me her whole life. We played, cuddled, napped together, took walks. She even gave me kisses sometimes, which is something she only does if she *really* likes you. She loves chicken and she purrs like a cat when she sleeps. 

And now she's dying. They're not going to put her through chemo. The vet doesn't think it would buy her much time, and they don't want her to suffer more than she has to. She has about 1-2 months.

My heart is shattered. There is something so cruel about the reality that these perfect, sweet creatures who do nothing but love us have such short lifespans. It's not fair. As if this year couldn't possibly get any worse.

And I can't even begin to imagine what my sister and BIL are feeling. My sister is disabled with several chronic illnesses and Asgard has been an enormous source of comfort for her through all of her pain. Whenever she isn't feeling well, Asgard is right there, curled up against her side. 

I cried when I had to leave because I thought it would be a long time before I'd see her again. I never imagined it would be the last time I'd see her. I wish more than anything that I could hold her and comfort her, but she's in another state and it's too risky to travel there with my sister being high risk for COVID. But I'm glad that I got to spend those 3 months with her. I'll be forever grateful for the time we spent together. 

Fuck cancer. Fuck 2020.",post

ixj0zx,"How do you accept that pets have such short lifespans?
My sister's dog, the most perfect, pure, sweet creature I've ever met, is dying from Lymphoma. My heart is broken. Another friend recently adopted a new puppy after losing her dog. Someday I'd like to adopt a dog of my own.

But feeling this grief now, I'm starting to wonder, how do you open your heart up to an animal knowing that they will die long before you do? How do you move on from the loss of a beloved pet and go on to adopt new pets knowing that it's going to be the same thing again and again? My heart is so broken. I long to have the companionship of a pet, but just knowing that they won't be around for long is so sad. I'm sure that the love you share with your pet is worth the heartbreak, but it comes at such a great price.",post
iymeea,"Got some food I didn't order
My instacart shopper gave me some stuff that wasn't part of my order. I didn't notice until I got inside. She was telling me I was her last order of the night so I'm guessing it was either her food, or part of her last order before mine, although the food was still cold to the touch so I'm pretty sure she just bought it. Is there any way to get in touch with her? I reported it through the app. I feel bad cos it's like $20 worth of meat.",post

j3dkjk,"So are disabled/sick people supposed to just fucking die?
There are so many people discussing their survival plans for if shit hits the fan in the US. Talking about going into the woods, fine-tuning their hunting skills, buying guns and several months worth of food and medical supplies. That's great for them. Glad they have a plan and a means to survive. 

But what the fuck are you supposed to do if you're not healthy or able-bodied? What if you're chronically ill and depend on medication to survive or have any quality of life? What if you're in a wheelchair? Are people like me and my loved ones supposed to just accept that when things get ugly we'll be left for dead? Like I said, more power to you if you have a means to survive on your own in a crisis, but it's really depressing knowing that you're not one of those people and that if comes to it, you'll be left behind.",post
j3pp6r,"A message to anyone trying to get out of Target- it gets better
No really. It gets better. Way fucking better. 

I just got a new job at a call center scheduling medical appointments. I have consistent hours, a decent pay rate, and good benefits. I'm allowed to have food and drinks at my desk. I get a full hour for lunch Weds-Friday. I can look at my phone as long as I'm not on a call. Everyone wears masks. And my managers treat me like an actual adult. They even check with me if they want to change my schedule. 

Last week I had a patient who was very angry that I couldn't magically make an appointment appear for her in October when we're already scheduling to the end of November. She started yelling, calling me names, typical Karen shit. She talked to my manager. My manager assured me that I did everything right and I had a laugh about it with one of my coworkers. I had a couple other shitty patients that day. Everyone just seemed to be in a foul mood. 

That was probably the worst day I've had at my new job and it wasn't even bad. I have not had a single day so far that even compares to the bullshit that I dealt with at Target. The impossible-to-meet expectations, the micromanaging, the constant pressure, the shitty customers. I used to have panic attacks at work because of all the stress. The lack of hours definitely didn't help with my stress levels either. 

I had to call out once at my new job because of a chronic illness flare and several people actually checked in with me when I got back to see if I was feeling better. I can't wrap my head around how much better I'm treated here, but at the same time it's sad to realize just how poorly treated retail workers are when basic human decency is a major improvement.

Anyway, my new job isn't perfect, but it's in a whole new league. For anyone trying to get out of Target right now, it might take some time to find a new job especially with the recession, but I can assure you there are workplaces out there that are sooooo much better. And you are not crazy or weak if you think Target is a difficult place to work because it absolutely fucking is. Keep searching and sending out those resumes.",post

j9j4nu,"I came out today
After a lifetime of questioning my sexual orientation, I've finally realized that I am pansexual and demisexual.

My sexuality has always been somewhat of a question mark. When i was in Kindergarten, I got ""engaged"" to a boy I was friends with. We kissed in secret behind the bushes once. 

When I was around 10, I had my first crush on a girl, one of my friends who rode the bus with me. 

When I was 12, I had my first real kiss with a close female friend of mine, and we experimented with each other for a few months. 

When I was 15, I fell head over heels in love with my female best friend. I briefly had a crush on a male friend, and another female friend.

When I was 20, I fell in love with a nonbinary friend who I met online and had been talking to for years.

I am definitely not asexual, nor aromantic. And yet, my attempts at dating have all been pretty unsuccessful. When a nice boy took me on a few dates at 17, I told him things weren't working out. When a very attractive guy at my university took me on a date and we fooled around at his place, I drifted away from him because I felt awkward and confused. When I joined Tinder to meet girls, several gorgeous ladies matched with me but I couldn't bring myself to meet up with any of them. It just didn't feel right. 

I've always been afraid to come out because my sexuality seemed so inconsistent. And to make matters all the more confusing, I do have kinks and sexual fantasies about all genders. So if I was a lesbian, why was I masturbating to solo male porn and fantasizing about getting fucked by a guy? Why didn't I want to go on a date with a pretty woman who wanted to date me? If I was bi or pan, then why did I feel so weird literally every time I went on a date with a guy? And if I was asexual, why did I have these secret fantasies about one of my dearest friends?

Turns out there's a name for what I am - demisexual. 

So I came out today. I'm so relieved that I've finally found a name for who I am, and to know that I am not alone. I'm not socially inept - I'm just not the kind of person who can meet someone and start a relationship with them right away. It might take a long time before I find someone to love, if I ever do, but that's okay. This is just who I am.",post
jawbob,"Is it normal to be this heartbroken for a dog that wasn't even mine?
My sister's dog was put to sleep yesterday. She was only 6 years old. She had lymphoma. At the beginning of quarantine I hunkered down with my sister and stayed at her place for 3 months, and during that time I bonded with her dog. We were best buds. For 3 months my entire camera roll was just pictures of her. She brought me so much joy during a scary time. 

I'm having a hard time processing it. Partly because I didn't get to be there when she passed, partly because she wasn't *my* dog. This isn't the first time I've been through this. When I was a kid my mom's friend had a sweet dog who I became friends with. Every day after school my mom and her friend would chat on the porch while me and Coco played in the yard. And then one day she got into something poisonous in the neighbor's garage (I think antifreeze) and that was it. My little heart was broken.

Now my heart is broken again. I've been crying on and off all day. When I first found out about her diagnosis I had a few days where I was devastated and couldn't stop crying, but I dried up for a couple weeks. Now it's all come flooding back. 

I just want to know, is this normal? To be this heartbroken for someone else's dog? Even though she wasn't mine I loved her so much. I can't believe I'm never going to see her again.",post
