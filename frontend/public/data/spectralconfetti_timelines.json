The maladaptive self-state is more dominant than the adaptive self-state, as it is characterized by a central organizing aspect of negative Affect, which influences the other aspects, including maladaptive behaviors and negative cognitions, and ultimately leads to a sense of despair and desperation. The adaptive self-state is present, but it is not as dominant as the maladaptive self-state, and it is characterized by a central organizing aspect of positive Desire/Need, which influences the other aspects, including positive Affect, adaptive Behavior, and adaptive Cognition, and ultimately supports psychological needs. The post highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing emotional and psychological abuse, and the need to prioritize self-affirmation and self-worth. The maladaptive self-state is characterized by a dominant negative affect of exhaustion and hopelessness, which drives maladaptive behaviors",
