        "body": "I've been dealing with severe fatigue since I was a teenager. It tends to happen in mini-episodes of 2-3 weeks inside of larger, long-term episodes of 4-8 months. I also have depression, and while I realize that depression can cause fatigue and low energy, I feel like my symptoms are different from what a lot of people with depression describe. For instance, sometimes when I'm very tired I feel strange electric zapping feelings in different parts of my body, or I see flashes of light. I've also experienced brief episodes of sleep paralysis, and I've been told that I look/act drunk when I'm very tired. I am taking two different antidepressants that are supposed to be energizing. I've eliminated caffeine from my diet. I've reduced my carb intake and upped my fat and protein. I do pilates 3 times a week and try to get in some cardio on the weekends if I have the energy for it. So I'm doing everything I can to be healthy but in spite of it all, my fatigue is as bad as it ever has been.\n\nI feel like I need to get a sleep study to know exactly what's wrong. I saw a sleep specialist several years ago and he basically felt my neck and said I needed to stop taking naps during the day. He gave me a temporary prescription for Provigil and asked me to stop taking naps for at least a few weeks. I couldn't do it, though, even with the Provigil. I would fall asleep involuntarily, or I would be completely unable to do anything productive because I was too tired to focus. When I went back to him and told him about it, he basically gave up on me and said that he couldn't help me if I didn't cooperate with him.\n\nSome nights I still fall asleep as early as 5 in the evening and sleep for a full 12 hours. It's like my body just can't get enough sleep no matter what I do. I'm miserable because of how constantly tired I am, and it's interfering with all aspects of my life. I know my doctors are going to try to blame it all on the depression, but that's not good enough for me. If I'm doing almost everything I'm supposed to do and I'm still having this much trouble, then something is wrong. I need help. But I don't know how to get a doctor to take me seriously enough to actually order a sleep study. Do you have any advice? \n\nEdit: For the record, I have been tested for multiple sclerosis, lyme, and mono. I don't have any of those. ",

        "body": "I know it's scary. Especially the first time. You've never touched the equipment before, you're not entirely sure how it works. You're self-conscious because you know that all the people around you can tell you're a beginner, and worse, that you're fat. You're scared that someone is going to laugh at you or take pictures of you or gossip to their workout buddies about you.\n\nBut I can assure you that these things are incredibly rare. Tons of us go to the gym regularly, myself included, and never experience any direct judgment. Most of the people in the gym are minding their own business trying to get their workout done. They aren't thinking about you. If they are, they probably aren't judging you. And if they are judging you, they're probably not seething with rage wishing you would die. And if they are, well, they have issues, and that's their problem, not yours.\n\nI know that just the possibility is terrifying, though. If you're scared, I recommend you try easing your way into it. Pick something really, really simple like the treadmill or the stationary bike. Look up a youtube tutorial on how to use it. Go to the gym. Walk in there like you own the place, and give it your best. It's a lot easier to develop confidence when you practice, and you're a lot less likely to mess up and do something embarrassing if you start slow and easy. It's really hard to screw up on the treadmill. And if you're too scared to be there when people are around, try looking for a 24-hour gym that you can go to very early in the morning or late at night so you can try being alone. You might also consider bringing a friend along, if that would help you feel safer.\n\nAnd in the event that some asshole does say something rude to you or take your picture, report them. Most gyms have strict policies against bullying or harassment of any kind and will at the very least give the person if a warning if they don't ban them outright. The staff want you to feel comfortable and safe there, and as a paying customer, you have just as much of a right to be there as anyone else.\n\nAbove all, keep in mind that weight loss is still more about diet than exercise. You can lose all the weight you need to lose while lying in bed all day - all it takes is eating at a caloric deficit. Exercising and going to the gym just gives you a boost. So even if you are too afraid to go to the gym, you can still lose weight. \n\nIf your anxiety is that severe, though, I would also recommend seeing a counselor or a therapist. You shouldn't have to miss out on the things you want to do because of your anxiety. You deserve to feel confident and relaxed in public just like everyone else, and your social anxiety isn't going to help you get to your goal any faster. ",

I had a 4.0 and everyone was so proud of me.\n\nSo when that suddenly became too hard I knew that something was wrong. When I couldn't keep my eyes open late at night to finish my work, when I started going to bed at 5 o'clock and missing assignments because I couldn't get myself up in the morning to work, when I started skipping class just because I was tired and couldn't get myself out of bed and worst of all, didn't *care*.\n\nThis behavior last year would've sent me into a panic attack. I would've cried and contemplated suicide if I thought my grades were in trouble, and now I still care, but not enough to do much about it. I'm still going to probably finish the semester with B's and maybe a couple of A's, but I can't shake the horrible feeling that I'm a bad student and that's all my professors are ever going to remember about me. That girl who skipped a lot of class and fell asleep in class, the one who missed several assignments, couldn't even be bothered to send an email when she was gone, poor sub-par quality work, couldn't answer questions in class and didn't ask them. These are the people I'm going to come back and ask for references when I graduate, and I don't think I deserve them. I don't deserve anything from them. I want to write all of them a nice long apology letter and send it to them at the end of the year but I know that would just be weird and it'd make them uncomfortable, so I won't, but I still feel awful. I don't deserve to be at this school when there are so many more talented, dedicated people here who actually work while I just lie around and sleep all the time. ",

        "title": "Vibrator desensitization - myth or no?",
        "body": "There seems to be a lot of debate as to whether long-term use of a vibrator can cause clitoral desensitization. Many women including myself have found that after using a vibrator for a certain amount of time, it becomes difficult to orgasm through gentler stimulation, and that over time we develop a \"tolerance\" and need more power to get the same results. My question is, does anyone know what actually causes this, and does anyone know if there's a way to fix it? \n\nOn the one hand, I think it might just be that stimulation takes time to get used to. It took me weeks to figure out how to orgasm using my fingers, and the first time I use a new vibrator is rarely ever the best. I usually need a few practice rounds to figure out how much pressure to use, where to press it, etc. before I figure out the magic combo that will give me a good orgasm. So it's possible that it's harder for me to orgasm using my fingers after I've been using a vibrator for so long just because I've forgotten what to do. It's also possible that my sex drive is lowering slowly over time. If I'm horny, I'm more sensitive, and it doesn't take much stimulation to get me going. When I'm not horny, it takes a little more effort to get going. So maybe it's just because now that I'm out of puberty I'm not as horny. But I'm not sure. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this? Does taking a break from vibrators restore sensitivity or make it easier to achieve orgasm in other ways?",

        "body": "It's going for $550 a month, utilities included. It's a little studio. The price isn't terribly unbelievable for this area, there are studios going for less although they tend to not be very nice. I contacted them via email and asked if I could come check the place out, they gave me a time and a first name. I told them I wouldn't be available during that time and suggested another date, they said they'd be available in the afternoon when they get off from work. \n\nThe things that don't seem right:\n\n- No address has been provided. I even asked for the address in my last email and they neglected to tell me. They have shown a clear intent to let me check out the apartment so I'm not giving up quite yet, but I find it suspicious that even now as we're making plans to meet I haven't received an address. Obviously we can't meet if I don't get an address, yet the person is definitely acting like they want to meet with me and show me the apartment, so...\n- In the ad, the apartment is listed as being available at two different dates. The person says at first that it'll be available June 1st, but later on the person says \"available as of now.\" Interesting.\n- The only personal info I've received is a generic first name. No phone number. While I realize some people are cautious about revealing personal information early on because of safety concerns, I feel like I at least should've been given a phone number to reach them at by now.\n- Apparently WiFi is included in the utilities. I don't have much experience with this so I have no idea if this is normal, but it seems to me like the only places that really offer WiFi are complexes, and this doesn't seem like it's part of a complex. Seems a bit too generous. \n\nThings that do seem right:\n\n- The person responds normally. Aside from not answering about the address, they use correct spelling and grammar and respond to questions like a human being, and their English is fine.  \n- The person has shown an intent to meet with me and let me see the apartment, even though they haven't provided the info yet. They haven't told me that they're out of town, that I can't see the apartment, or any of those other red flags. \n- They haven't asked for any info from me yet. I provided my name, but they haven't asked for anything from me so far.\n- The person hasn't given me a bunch of weird irrelevant details or sob stories. They don't claim to be from Nigeria. Pretty much the only communication we've had so far is us trying to figure out a time that I can come by and look at the apartment. \n- The photos look like they were taken with a phone or a regular camera - they don't look like the nice photos you see on property websites that someone could just take and use for a fake ad. The photos also show furnishings and decorations, which gives me the impression that this person lives or lived there and is planning to move and rent it out to someone. I'll have to ask about that if I do meet them. But I at least know that there is or was a person living there.\n- The pictures match the description, and the description is reasonably detailed. \n\n\nSo yeah. If they ever do get back to me with that address, I plan to take a buddy and go look at the place this afternoon. I don't plan on signing or returning any forms until I've seen some identification and received a number so I can look them up. And I plan on looking up the address once I have it to see if it comes up as being owned by someone else. But yeah. Does this seem scammy? Given that the person does get back to me with an address, are there any specific questions I should ask to tell if this is legit? ",

I couldn't seem to keep myself afloat and I would tire out before I made it three feet. \n\nWell, last semester I took a pilates class at uni because I needed the credit. Wasn't expecting to get anything out of it, but I made a lot of progress and was really proud of myself. I had planned to continue with the pilates during the summer but quickly slipped into my usual lazy, unmotivated summer routine, and before I knew it I was gaining weight and feeling defeated again. I figured any progress I had made in the pilates class was gone by now. \n\nI went to the pool with my friend last week. She was going to try to teach me how to swim. I didn't think it would work, and I figured at best I might be able to sort of doggy paddle around. Within literally minutes of being in the water, though, I was swimming all on my own. I don't know what I was missing before - core strength, stamina, endurance - but I did it, and it came to me just like that. I guess I had it in me all along. \n\nSo we had a good time and I decided to sign up for a beginning swimming class at uni this fall. And over the rest of the summer I'm planning to make regular trips to the pool so I can keep it up. I think I might've found an exercise that I actually like, something that doesn't feel completely tedious and boring.  \n\nSo yeah. Never underestimate yourself or tell yourself that you can't do something! ",

From what I gathered, it seems like Tom for whatever reason is in denial about the dangers of staying at the farm and refuses to evacuate with everyone else, hence he gets very upset when he catches Murph's friend checking his son's lungs and makes the comment about \"going to live underground.\" \n\nI'm also a little confused by the obvious tension between the two of them. Tom mentions in his video message that the family doesn't see Murph very much, which gives me the impression that she sort of ran off and isolated herself when she got older. And when she comes to visit and has dinner with the family, she seems visibly uncomfortable and Tom appears annoyed with her when she says the \"too many memories\" line. So it's obvious that there's something going on between them, but I feel like that was never really explained. \n\nDoes anyone have a better explanation for all of that? I just don't quite understand why Tom was so adamant about staying, especially considering his first kid died. But we don't really learn much about his character in the beginning of the film so it's hard for me to say if it makes sense for him.",

When I walk fast or uphill or when I climb stairs, the area just behind my ankle and up my calf about 5-6 inches starts to feel very tight, stiff, and sore. After it starts to hurt, the more I walk, the worse it gets. It seems like extending my foot worsens it, and if I walk by sort of marching without bending my feet at all, it helps a little. I carry a very heavy backpack to and from school every day, and the added weight definitely makes it worse. I'm also obese, which I realize is definitely a contributing factor. It can get very bad, to the point that I need to sit down and rest because it feels like something in my leg is going to just snap at any second, like my muscles are rubber bands that are being stretched to their limits. Any thoughts on what might be causing this pain and what I can do in both the long and short term to fix it? I realize losing weight will help, but is there anything I can do now to make it a little less horrible? Icing it seems to help, but the only thing that really alleviates it is resting, which isn't an option because I need to walk to school and go to classes and whatnot. \n\nAge: 21\nSex: F\nHeight: 5'1\nWeight: 175 lbs\nRace: White\nLocation: USA; outer calf/ankles, both\n",

It was a bad week and I didn't expect this week to be any better.\n\nThis week I started my period. I am prone to very severe pain and cramping during my period that can sometimes be debilitating.

I left the house every day except for Tuesday, but I didn't have class on Tuesday. And I got my homework turned in.

You know what else is dangerous and can cause potentially life-threatening side effects? Chemotherapy. It can completely fuck you up and leave your body permanently damaged. But you know why people do it? Because if they don't, they're going to die of cancer anyway. \n\nMy illness is no different. I know that psychotropic medications aren't risk-free. I know that they can cause health issues, some of which may be life-threatening.  But my depression is also life-threatening, and if given the choice between a low risk of bad side effects and a moderate risk of death by suicide, I'd think you would want me to choose the medication. Even if I weren't suicidal, is it really fair of you to expect me to go on living my life in misery just because *you're* worried that my medications could hurt me? At the very least, my medications are palliative. They relieve my pain and allow me to function somewhat normally and do the things that you take for granted.

But with my depression it's somehow different to you, and the fact that you aren't able to see my illness for what it is tells me that you don't take my depression seriously or believe that I am genuinely suffering.\n\n/rant\n\n",

        "body": "I strongly suspect that I may have ADHD. I literally spent the past two hours writing out a complicated list of my symptoms and memories and experiences, but it was getting too long, so I'm going to have to ask you to take my word. Of course, I'm not a doctor and I can't diagnose myself. But I've been doing research, and much of what I've read about it so far clicks with me. I also have a family history. My father was diagnosed with it, though he doesn't receive treatment because he doesn't believe ADHD is real, and my brother had it very severely, to the point that he was having frequent breakdowns and tantrums up into his late teens. My parents kicked him out when they couldn't deal with him anymore. \n\nSo I think by the time I came along, they were burned out from dealing with him. I had tantrums up until I was in my early teens. I couldn't stand still in line at school. But I did well in class and I had friends and my teachers liked me, so as far as they were concerned I was he best kid ever.\n\nThe thing is, I've been struggling for my whole life with a lot of symptoms. I just assumed that they were normal, that they were personality flaws, or that they were caused by my depression. And I've been seeing multiple professionals for my depression for a while now.\n\nI started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago because none of the antidepressants I'd tried were helping, and my GP wasn't comfortable prescribing anything else. After a couple more trials with antidepressants that didn't help or had awful side effects, my psychiatrist put me on Ritalin to help with fatigue and concentration. And while I'm on a very low dose, I have noticed some improvement in my symptoms. I even started an assignment a few days before it was due last week - I can't remember the last time I did that.\n\nThe thing is, now that I've become aware of these problems, I can't ignore them. I need to pursue it and find out what's going on, whether it's ADHD or something else. And the first step is to approach my psychiatrist. But I'm scared he won't believe me. He has no reason to. I'm a good student. I have a 3.8 GPA. Given, I'm taking a reduced course load now and I had to petition to have my scholarship reinstated last semester because I had to withdraw from half of my classes because I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and couldn't keep up with anything, and I failed a major project the previous semester because of my procrastination... But as far as he can see by looking at my records, I'm a model student, and that scares me. I don't know what to do. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? How do you convince people that you need help when some of the usual places they look for evidence seem normal? I don't know how to prove that I need help and I'm scared he'll just write me off as a drug seeker or think that I'm making it up for attention. On the surface I look fine, but I am so not fine and my life is falling apart. \n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nSo, good news. I decided to schedule an appointment to see my old psychologist instead of the psychiatrist first, hoping he might be able to talk me through the process and ease my anxiety about the situation. He's started my evaluation and had me fill out a questionnaire, and now he's given me some forms for my sister and one of my friends to fill out. Once those are in I should find out very soon about my diagnosis, and after that I will meet with the psychiatrist to talk about medication and such. But my psychologist said my responses are very consistent with ADHD, so if all goes well, I will get the diagnosis and things will go a lot smoother from there. \n\nI'm a bit nervous about the forms, though. The one I'm giving to my sister is really intended for parents, but I don't really have the kind of relationship with my parents where that would be a viable option. My mom stubbornly refuses to believe anything is ever wrong with me, and my dad doesn't even really believe in ADHD, so I'm really hoping my sister remembers my childhood well enough for this. We'll see, I guess. \n\nAnyway, thank you all for your supportive comments and advice, I really appreciate it. &lt;3",

One of the big reasons I have trouble cooking up healthy meals is because of the amount of time it takes me to actually prepare the ingredients, so something like that could save me a lot of time and energy. I also got a vegetable peeler, which has been really helpful. But, that's just kitchen stuff. If you guys can recommend anything at all that makes your life easier, whether it's an app or an appliance, please feel free to share those. I'd love to hear your suggestions. \n\nEdit: My mom also gave me a clothing steamer for Christmas. It gets the wrinkles out of my clothes but it's way easier to use than an iron. So on those days where I don't have the energy to fold my clothes and definitely don't have the energy to iron, I can still keep my dignity, sort of.",

I can choose not to answer certain questions or ask that we change the subject if I don't feel like talking about something, but I will not outright lie to her. If something is so hard to talk about that I can't say it out loud, I'll write her a note. \n\nAnd that includes being honest with her about the things she says and my thoughts on them. That includes telling her when I disagree with her or don't feel that her advice is helping me. That includes telling her how I feel when she says certain things. \n\nHopefully by doing this, she can get a better idea of what needs to be worked on.

And then I remembered I had some wine in the fridge and thought I should try to look for something to pair with it, so I researched pizza and wine pairings, but then I realized I shouldn't be drinking on a school night when I had homework to do, so I nixed the wine idea and settled for pepperoni and sausage.

Again, I have noticed the palps happening more often, but yesterday I had a very scary episode with them. I basically had what felt like several palps in a row and it freaked me out. I felt kind of faint and like I was going into a sudden panic attack, but it stopped as suddenly as it started.\n\nNow I'm planning to go back to my doc asap. I am hoping he can refer me to a cardiologist to do more extensive testing, but I'm not feeling optimistic. What if it turns out that it isn't safe for me to take this anymore? I feel like I'm running out of options. I've felt great since I started Adderall and I don't know what I'm going to do if stimulants are off the table for me. I'm severely fatigued, depressed, only attending school halftime. Antidepressants have only provided mild benefits. I've tried 3 different SSRIs and Wellbutrin, only Prozac seemed to help but I still accomplished very little and couldn't focus. \n\nIf I keep going like this without some kind of help I don't see myself ever graduating or getting a decent job.

It seems a little glitchy at times, though, so I wouldn't rely on it exclusively just in case it decides to crap out on you. But it does well for me as a sort of interactive to-do list. ",

        "body": "So I've been using the pomodoro technique lately and I've found it to be fairly helpful. However, I've been having some anxiety lately and I've gotten quite behind on some important projects coming up, so working has become really difficult. It's hard enough to concentrate as it is, and it's nearly impossible to concentrate when you're anxious, and when the work you're trying to do is the source of your anxiety. I tried a lot of traditional relaxation techniques, but they didn't seem to help. It's hard to relax when you can't clear your mind, and when you spend your entire break being anxious about your work, it's not really a break anymore.\n\nSo, I decided to try something different and googled \"relaxing games.\" I happened upon this neat little collection of flash games called **[Orisinal](http://www.ferryhalim.com/)**, by someone named Ferry Halim. They're basically a bunch of cute, artistic little mini-games. Very simple, but not to the point that they're boring. The artwork and music are lovely, and once you get into a rhythm, it does start to become somewhat relaxing.\n\nSince I've started playing these games between work sessions, I actually have found that I'm a lot more productive. I'm less tempted to quit early and I don't feel as overwhelmed, and I find it easier to get back to work because I feel like I've had an actual break. Sometimes distraction is a good thing. So yeah, I would definitely recommend giving these a shot if you struggle with some of these things. Just make sure you set a timer and stick to the limit you set, because it's really easy to get sucked into the \"just one more round\" habit. ",

Suddenly everything made sense and I put all the pieces together. I saw my psychologist, he evaluated me, and I had my diagnosis. \n\nThere's a thought that's been pestering me, though - how is it possible that I never figured it out before? How did I not realize it? I've been doubting myself this whole time, wondering if maybe I'm just making problems where they don't exist, because if I did have ADHD, surely I would've noticed before now.\n\nWell, I apparently I did. I was sorting through some cheesy songs and lyrics I wrote when I was a brooding teen, and I stumbled across this:\n\n&gt; Life is going by too fast\n\n&gt; Time is slipping through my hands\n\n&gt; Each second like a grain of sand\n\n&gt; Broken hourglass, my prison\n\n&gt; Trapped by walls of pride and selfish need\n\n&gt; Bound by chains of false misery\n\n&gt; Ignorance is bliss to me\n\n&gt; What lies ahead, I cannot see\n\n&gt; Life goes on, running, running\n\n&gt; Rapid movement\n\n&gt; Thoughts come in too fast\n\n&gt; Can't comprehend\n\n&gt; I move on, a lost and troubled ghost\n\n&gt; Knowing that nobody knows\n\n&gt; Going down the same old roads\n\n&gt; Unseen and long-forgotten\n\nSo, yeah. Maybe not the best lyrics and a little corny/self-indulgent, but holy shit. I mean, I wrote this probably 7 or 8 years ago but it wasn't until now that it all finally came together. But I've been suffering for a long time and it pains me to look back and remember what I was going through. I've realized that a lot of the depression and isolation I experienced as a teen probably had something to do with the ADHD, but I just never put the pieces together and assumed that I was your typical moody kid. Of course, I had a tendency to be melodramatic and self-indulgent at times, like most teens do, but if this song doesn't spell out \"ADHD\" I don't know what does.",

I wish they worked synergistically so I could take both, but obviously that isn't how they work, so yeah.\n\nI'm thinking my best option going forward would be to try some of the other drugs in each of these classes to figure out which one  is best. I'd like to give Vyvanse or one of its equivalents a shot, and then perhaps Concerta or something similar if that doesn't work out. I'm somehwat satisfied but there are definitely things that could be a lot better when I'm on either drug. \n\nMy question is, would this look suspicious to a doctor?

I just had too much homework, and I had to be up early for a morning class. \n\nThen I was busy from morning until around 7. By the time I got home, I was exhausted, and I fell asleep right away. But my brain was like, \"oh we just took a nap that's cool\" and decided midnight was a good time for me to wake up.\n\nSo I got up at midnight. And did stuff until morning, and then I went to class.\n\nThen it came time for the most important part of the day. I was supposed to record a song for an audio technology class. I had a room reserved, I'd rented the equipment I needed, everything was set. Except I hadn't practiced the song much since I hadn't had time, but I'm a pretty competent sight-reader and I learn quickly, so I didn't think it'd be an issue.\n\nNope. Nope. Nope.\n\nI have never played so terribly before. I could not for the life of me read the music or play the right notes or even remember where I was on the page. I started to get angry and had a mini-meltdown, wondering if this was a sign that the Adderall wasn't working after all and I was going to be stuck like this forever. \n\nAnd then as I was packing up to leave it finally hit me that I hadn't slept more than 7 hours in the past two days. \n\nIt's weird because it didn't even register that that was the problem. I was tired all day and ravenously hungry even after my meds and I felt cold and irritable, but I just didn't think about it. Normally people talk about forgetting to eat when they're on Adderall, but apparently you can forget to sleep, too.\n\nSo, yeah. I have learned my lesson. Your meds will not help you concentrate if your brain is running on nothing. And you will feel like poop, but the Adderall will keep you awake enough to forget exactly how sleep deprived you are. Don't forget to sleep. I'm going to bed now. ",

I was connected to the same driver and, once again, the status changed to \"on trip\" after a few moments. Meanwhile, I noticed my driver began moving further and further away from me, in the direction of my destination. She couldn't have been trying to turn, because the area she was in is basically a gridlock. There are no one-way streets, so there's no reason she would've needed to go so far out of her way to get to me. And I doubt that it was an accident or that someone else tried to steal my ride considering she did it twice. The fact that she started driving away from me tells me she probably had no intention of picking me up to begin with. I canceled this trip when I realized she wasn't coming for me and disputed the charges for both trips, receiving a refund. \n\nBut I'm still not sure what happened.

Ritalin is like putting on mental glasses - everything is clearer, more focused. I feel sharp, I can remember things, I'm able to plan and do things ahead of time, I'm more productive.\n\nAdderall is like adding battery life to my brain and putting on distraction blinders. My fatigue is dramatically reduced. I can stay awake through the entire day without needing to lie down for a long nap. At the same time, I feel more content and able to ignore distractions. I normally struggle with misophonia (irritability, anxiety, and agitation caused by certain sounds) and other sensory issues, sometimes to the point that it becomes almost debilitating. But with Adderall these issues become more tolerable. I don't spend the every day walking around feeling like I want to punch a wall and cry because there are too many things happening around me. \n\nBut Adderall doesn't help me with focus, memory, or concentration. And Ritalin doesn't even touch my fatigue, nor does it help with my moods or irritability or distractibility. On Adderall, I forget words. I lose track of what I'm saying or thinking about. I continue to procrastinate. So even though I'm awake and feeling much better, I don't get anything done because my brain is still in a fog. And on Ritalin, I'm still sleepy. I still take 3-hour naps and accidentally fall asleep at 7 in the evening. I still feel groggy, weak, heavy, agitated. So I get things done, but only during the short window of time that I'm actually fully awake, and I'm still miserable. \n\nIt's so frustrating. I feel like if it were possible to combine both everything would be perfect, but I've heard that they can't be combined. Does anyone know specifically why or have documentation for that? \n\nI don't know what to do. I know I can try different formulations of each drug, but it's hard to say whether either one can make up for the deficits that the other covers. The only solution I can think of is to see if there are any other, non-stimulant drugs that can make up for these deficits. Like, perhaps I could add something like modafinil onto the Ritalin (if that's possible) to help me with the fatigue. Or perhaps there's another ADHD drug I can combine with the Adderall (I already take Wellbutrin, though, doesn't seem to make a difference either way.) \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way, or has anyone else dealt with this?\n",

A few weeks before I'd had a sudden epiphany while watching a video where a woman described her ADHD, and it all just made sense. All the pieces fell together and I suddenly knew *why* I couldn't make myself pay attention, why I procrastinated, why my apartment was a trainwreck, why I was constantly stressed, why I \"zoned out\" all the time, why I had a hard time following instructions, why I couldn't sit down and just read a book, why I sucked at responding to messages, why I couldn't remember the simplest of things...\n\n... and up until then I'd blamed it all on myself. I thought I was lazy. I thought I just didn't really care. I thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. I thought that I must have been too spoiled as a child, and that's why I couldn't seem to take care of myself or function like a normal adult. So when I figured out what was really going on and talked to my therapist about it, it was like an enormous weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I didn't have to feel guilty anymore, it wasn't my fault, I wasn't lazy or spoiled.\n\nAnd yet, I still had hope. \n\nI still believed that if I *really* wanted to, I could change and shape myself into the normal, functional adult I wanted to be. I still thought that if I just really pushed myself to pay attention, I'd be able to pay attention, and if I really pushed myself to be more organized, I'd become more organized, and so on, and I truly believed it was going to happen. I truly thought that I would someday get my depression under control and get my shit together and then I would just transform into this beautiful, healthy woman who gets up early in the morning to go to the gym and cook breakfast before beginning a productive, busy day and settling down in a clean home. \n\nAnd now that I have my diagnosis I'm starting to realize that that's just a fantasy. Now I know that no matter how much I want to be able to focus and do all of these things, my brain will not let me. Or if it does, it will be a constant uphill battle, and one that I just don't have the energy to fight. I've tried Ritalin and Adderall, with some success, but not enough. No antidepressant is helping. I've been to therapy for two years. \n\nI don't know what I'm doing wrong. I just want to reach a level where I can kind of live normally but I'm scared that it'll never happen. I'm scared that I'll end up either homeless or living with my parents until I finally break down and kill myself. I'm scared that I'll never find love, because who would want to live with someone who's as much of a trainwreck as I am? I'm scared that I'll never find a stable job or finish college, I'm scared that it's never going to get better.\n\nI just need to know... I need to know that there's a reason to continue fighting. I need to know that life with ADHD is worth it, because right now it doesn't feel like it, and I don't know how much longer I can keep wrestling with my brain when I know now that it's more or less useless, or that even if I do manage to improve, I'll have to fight with myself for the rest of my life.

You can occasionally hear a little bit of straining to reach notes, like in the song from Full Disclosure. But even the female singing parts tend to hang around in a very low range. Peace and Love on the Planet Earth, Do It for Her, and Something Entirely New all go down to an E3, which is unreachable for some female singers. Even Stronger Than You, which is one of the only songs I've noticed the style of singing is also very gentle, mostly kept in head voice - I think that kind of maintains the conversational aspect of it. The only real exception is Strong in the Real Way, I think. \n\nBut, yeah, that's just a small detail I kind of appreciate, and as an alto I find it especially refreshing. And it's clear that it's not simply because of a lack of skill - Deedee Magno Hall is an *amazing* singer who has performed in broadway and she is more than capable of pushing the upper limits of her range. And Estelle is also a professional singer. So it's really neat that we get to hear this part of the female singing range instead, which is something that I find to be more rare in today's popular music. Plus it's nice because it makes the music a bit more singable for the viewers. It's fun to be able to sing along. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to mention it because it makes me happy.

I imagine the whole point of the exercise was to teach us to follow instructions and work as a team. But, unfortunately, I forgot one of the steps and tried to do something too soon. Immediately my gym teacher started yelling at me, and then he made me sit in the corner for the rest of the period. While everyone else was playing, he came over and lectured me about how kids who don't pay attention don't get to have fun. And I was like, six or seven years old. \n\nAnd I know I was punished and scolded for not paying attention at least a few other times, but nothing in particular sticks out at me. \n\nI just... Maybe I don't get it because I was never a normal kid, but is not paying attention something healthy people do on purpose? I always felt so humiliated when I was called out because I was trying so, so hard to focus. But instead of just correcting us and asking us to pay attention, it seemed like teachers went out of their way to embarrass and shame children for getting distracted. \n\nAnd it did have a really negative effect on me, because it taught me that I needed to hide and mask my ADHD symptoms in order to be a \"good\" kid. It taught me that I should always watch what others were doing before I acted, since I couldn't trust myself to remember instructions. It taught me to nod my head and make little gestures to pretend that I was paying attention. It taught me to raise my hand as often as possible when I did know the answer, so that my teachers wouldn't call on me when I didn't know the answer. I can't help but feel that if I hadn't been treated this way, I might've gotten the help I needed much sooner. \n\nSo... I don't know. What's the deal with attentiveness in children? Is it something they have to be taught? Does punishing them actually do anything? ",

        "body": "So, I've been wearing 36FF's, and apparently I'm a 34HH/H or a 36GG/H according to the calculator. \n\nI own four bras in the incorrect size. On all of them, the bands feel loose. None of the gores touch my sternum. My boobs tend to fall out of the underwires a little throughout the day so the underwire is floating. One of my bras gives me quadboob. Two of my bras have underwires that poke me in the armpits really badly and it's very annoying and uncomfortable. I'm 5'1 so it's hard to say if it's due to poor overall fit or if it's because of my short torso. \n\nI did try on a 34GG bra at one point but it was way, way, way too tight. I could barely get it to clasp and it felt like I was wearing a corset. So I'm not sure about the band size. Will a larger cup size make that much of a difference?\n\nAs for the shapes of my breasts, I'm not 100% sure, but I think I have projected breasts with slightly narrow roots that are fuller on top. There's a small gap between them, but they hang straight and point forward rather than splaying out. I'd say they're somewhere between [this](http://media.glamour.com/photos/569592e093ef4b09520d246c/master/w_743,c_limit/fashion-2015-08-breasts-for-unlined-bra-main.jpg) and [this](http://media.glamour.com/photos/569592e0d9dab9ff41b2a607/master/w_743,c_limit/fashion-2015-08-breasts-full-coverage-bra-main.jpg) in terms of their overall outline. From the side, they look like [this.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--3-Wq358H9s/URCIw3eD9UI/AAAAAAAACTI/lfWQVG5jqGc/s1600/tricky+full+on+top.png)\n\nNow, onto measurements:\n\n**Snug underbust:** 34.5 inches\n\n**Tight underbust:** 33 inches\n\n**Standing:** 44 inches\n\n***Leaning:*** 49 inches \n\n**Lying:** 47 inches\n\nI am not sure that my leaning measurement is accurate because the curvature of my spine is a little messed up and I may have mild kyphosis. As a result, [this](http://imgur.com/a/70xCS) is what I look like when I bend over, compared to the image from the guide. So I think my weird back might be interfering with that measurement, because that seems off to me and I feel like there shouldn't be a difference of 5.5 inches. \n\nSo, yeah. If you could let me know what you think of the measurements, and also recommend any bras in my size (once I figure out for sure what it is) that aren't going to stab my armpits (preferably no more than $60-75 USD, the less expensive the better), that would be awesome.

I am considering going to my school's accessibility services to ask about accommodations, but I learned my college's counseling center now offers something called \"ADHD evaluation\" for like $200. I did not have to pay $200 for what I did with the school psychologist. He had me fill out some paperwork and had my sister and best friend also fill out some paperwork. So I imagine this \"evaluation\" probably involves some actual testing.\n\nI don't know if I'll be required to go through that for the accommodations or not. Their policy is really unclear about it. But if I do need it, well, I'm kind of nervous.\n\nWhat happens during the testing? Do you like play a special game on a computer or something? Does a psychologist or psychiatrist listen to you talk? How do they determine whether you have ADHD or not?\n\nIt makes me nervous because I know there's no completely accurate, foolproof \"test\" for ADHD, and I've always been somewhat unusual. I've always been a high-achieving student and I actually do pretty well on tests. So I'm worried that they'd just see me doing well on whatever tests they have and decide that means I don't actually have ADHD or something. If I could just take them home with me and let them watch how I live and do things I think they'd get it, but no one ever thought I might have a problem as a kid because my academic performance was above average, and I'm worried that it'll be the same way with this evaluation, whatever it is. \n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to expect if it turns out I do need that. :\\",

Like do they want you to just be not obese, or do they want you to be not at all overweight? I'm 13 lbs away from not obese and 39 lbs away from not overweight, so, yeah. I'd like to know how much weight I need to lose first. My insurance specifies that a patient needs to have completed 3 months of treatment to reduce symptoms, and one such treatment is a \"weight loss program,\" but there is nothing in the policy about the amount of weight they want you to lose. \n- Do you have any say in how much tissue is removed? A part of me is afraid that they'll take too much and I'll end up with really small boobs. I'd like for them to be proportional to the rest of my figure. According to my insurance's chart based on body surface area, they would need to remove around 600-650 g of tissue (at minimum?), but I don't really know what that means. \n- How long would you say a *full* recovery takes? By a full recovery, I mean no more pain and being able to do all the things you could before. I'm a college student, so if healing would take a long time, I'll either need to do this in the summer or take a semester off from school. \n- How much help do you need after surgery? Do you need someone to take care of you full-time? Are you able to get out of bed and do small, non-strenuous activities on your own? My mom is disabled, and my dad works a lot. So if this is the kind of surgery where I would be bedridden for an extended period of time, I'm not really sure what I could do, because I don't really have anyone who could take care of me. \n- For those who've had the surgery and had it covered by insurance, how much did you have to pay?\n- What was your wait time for surgery? Like how far ahead was it scheduled?",

The side effects were intolerable, though, so we stopped. \n\nShe then suggested the Mirena since it's a low dose with milder systemic effects. Still, the Mirena has also been linked to my condition. My neurologist said she would look into it, but she moved before I could get an appointment with her. \n\nAfter that my symptoms kind of stopped and I had normal periods for a few years. Then recently my cycle changed. Period started coming way early or way late, lots of light prolonged bleeding. I bled continously (but lightly) for two weeks.

CT was normal and showed no evidence of appendicitis, cysts, or masses. I'm not anywhere close to my period. \n\nSo I'm at a loss. Gonna go back to gyno.

But I still can't seem to shake that awful feeling that my music doesn't belong to me. \n\nSometimes it's also tricky because, after listening to my own music so much, it'll start to feel familiar in my head. And then I can't tell if it sounds familiar because I've heard it somewhere else or because I've listened to it so many times while practicing it. \n\nAny thoughts? ",

I was already working with them to take a reduced course load, but I decided to see if they could offer any other accommodations. And I learned they actually had a lot more available to me than I thought!\n\nSo I'm renting something really cool from them called a LiveScribe pen. Basically it's a pen that records audio. You write on a special kind of paper with it, and it syncs your writing up with the audio so you can go back to specific portions of a lecture if you miss anything while taking notes or need to go over something again. I haven't tried it out yet, but I'm very excited. They also told me that if I like it, I can keep it. \n\nI'm also going to give them my receipts for my books, and they can contact the publishers and send me electronic copies. Which will make my life a whole lot easier, since I'll have the ability to easily search and navigate through my books. There's also some software I might try out that basically reads your ebooks to you, and also allows you to highlight things insert notes and whatnot.\n\nSo yeah. Just thought I'd share that, because it made me happy. It's so wonderful to know that there are people who care about my disorder, take it seriously, and want to help me. If you're a university student with diagnosed ADHD, and you're struggling, you should definitely look into what services your school offers for students with disabilities. You never know, they might be able to help. ",

So I decided to see if we could try something else.\n\nHe just kind of shrugged at me like \"what do you want me to do?\" He basically told me that, statistically speaking, the chances of another one working when the others didn't are small. Which isn't untrue, but... I don't know. Already it was starting to rub me the wrong way. And it only got worse. He didn't even remember what meds I was currently taking or what my treatment history was like, hadn't bothered to review that info beforehand. Spent a good five minutes with his back turned to me looking at my chart. \n\nHe asked me if I exercised. I told him I've been trying to walk a bit more, at least. He told me I should be getting some kind of moderate intensity exercise three times a week and that will probably help. That's great. I'll add that to my to-do list, behind getting out of bed, showering, wearing clean clothes, eating actual food, going to class, doing homework, and trying not to sleep for stretches of 12+ hours. \n\nI just feel so defeated. He eventually prescribed another SSRI. On my way out he said, \"I hope this is the magic one that works for you.\" It sounded almost sarcastic. \n\nI don't know what to do. He's the only psych at my school. And outside of the school, pretty much every psychiatrist in town is booked or they don't accept insurance. And even if they do, even if I get in to see one, I'm probably losing my insurance within the next two years, so I wouldn't be able to keep them for very long. \n\nEverything is just a mess. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. It seems like it's so simple for everyone else. They take the pills and suddenly their lives turn around and they're all better. Maybe if I cared more, maybe if I weren't so lazy... Maybe it's my fault that I'm not better yet. Maybe I just don't want to get better. \n\nI feel like I'd be better off dead at this point. I don't see the point in living knowing that I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life, even if it comes and goes and I have periods of relief.

I know where the brands are but a lot of the merchandise within those brands is very similar. I also don't really get how the DCPI numbers work. The other day an LOD got kinda pissed at me because I was taking too long in a section I hadn't spent much time in. I just don't know how to get better other than by doing it more and I worry that they're going to get impatient and fire me if I don't catch up soon. \n\nSo... what can I do? Do you have any tips or tricks for figuring out what goes where and memorizing it? Would it be weird for me to just go in on my day off and spend some time studying the different sections? \n\nAlso, another question: what should I do when a guest needs help finding something and I don't know where it is and don't have a MyDevice? I normally direct them to a nearby co-worker if someone is around or ask quickly on the radio, but an LOD scolded me for doing that too much and told me I need to be able to tell them myself so I don't keep them waiting.

I'm very used to playful teasing and comments from friends and coworkers about my height. It's kind of a running gag.  Occasionally customers will have a chuckle with me when I can't reach something, or I'll have a heart to heart with a fellow vertically challenged woman about the struggle of finding pants that fit. Still, people typically don't bring it up out of the blue. But sometimes customers, especially the older folks, make weird comments like that. \n\nSo I just laughed and said, \"Yes, I am!\" with a nod, trying to take it in stride and be a good, polite retail bot. She probably meant it as a joke, I was sure. \n\nThe woman looked confused, though. She held up the panties. \"You never have my size.\" I kind of chuckled, but I still didn't quite understand what she was getting at. \n\n\"Yeah, if only underwear came in petites, right?\"  \n\nShe looked even more confused. And then she realized. \"No, no, I meant short supply. You're short on underwear. When do you think you'll get some more in?\"\n\nI died a little inside once I figured out what she meant. So I did my best to help her find a large and that was that. I just thought it was a funny little misunderstanding. ",

But I learned to live exactly like my parents did.\n\nNow I'm an adult living alone and it's working out about as well as you'd expect. My apartment looks like a literal trainwreck. I've made numerous attempts to tackle the mess, and each time, I'll make it maybe a third of the way through before I lose steam and give up, or else something gets in the way. I'm severely depressed, so not only do I lack the actual skills to take care of myself, but I don't even have the motivation to try and develop them. \n\nIt's sad. I probably spend 95% of my time at home in bed, either browsing the internet or sleeping or wishing I could sleep or pretending to watch TV while I space out for hours, surrounded by clutter and trash. Just like my sick, bedridden Mom. I don't entirely blame her and Dad. And it doesn't really matter now whose fault it is that I never learned to be an adult, because I'm the only one now who can fix it. But sometimes I don't want to fix it. I'm already so tired. \n\nAnyway. Who else was never taught how to adult or do basic life things? ",

And if I don't, then *I'm* the one who gets scolded for it at the end of the night because it's not \"brand.\" And yet if I do, I get yelled at for taking too long and told that I need to work on my pace. Literally can't win. He's not the only one, of course. And guess what our leadership's response is when we complain to them about it? \"You need to take it up with that person and figure it out yourself. Own your area.\" \n\nWhat. The. Actual. Fuck. Your literal fucking job is to hold people accountable and make sure they're doing their jobs correctly. If you can't do even that then what the fuck are you getting paid for?

        "body": "So about 3 months ago I had to get a root canal. Dentist put me on a regular course of amoxicillin as a precaution but that ended up being a very bad idea, as I immediately began having the worst IBS flare of my life. Over the next several months:\n\n- I puked into my bathtub while sitting on the toilet because my cramps were so bad, twice\n- I almost ended up in the ER and had to go to urgent care several times\n- I was sent home from work early several times, once because I shat my pants\n- I experienced almost 2 weeks of nothing but unpredictable watery diarrhea, anywhere from 1-5 times a day\n- I lost 12 lbs from eating so little\n- I had to get tested for c.diff (which was negative) \n\nEventually my doctor recommended that I try the probiotic S. boulardii. S. boulardii is known to be effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea because it's actually technically a yeast, so the antibiotics don't kill it off before it has the chance to work. I wasn't sure it would help since the damage was already done, and I'd already tried 2 other probiotics with minimal results (and probiotics are expensive.) But finally I decided to to give it a go. \n\nWithin about 5 days of starting it, I was able to eat foods that I wouldn't have even dared to try before. My stool started to become more solid and consistent and the color also returned to normal, as it had been consistently yellow before. Even the odor is better. The only side effects I've had are some mild gas, and some painless constipation that's responding well to Benefiber. I'm still not quite 100% better. I have to take my Levsin and enzymes and whatnot with heavy meals. Sometimes I get minor cramping, bloating, gas. I've had diarrhea a couple times.  But this is nothing compared to the pain I was having before. I actually ate Chipotle today, which is something I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to do again.\n\nSo yeah. S. boulardii is pretty dope. The brand name is Florastor. I'm using the Walgreens store brand because it's cheaper. Obviously I can't say whether it could help you because this shit is complicated and there's so much that goes into it, but if you start flaring after antibiotics it may be worth looking into (or better yet, you can try taking it with the antibiotics.)",

I know they'll probably want to do a hysteroscopy for the polyps and I've read that sometimes the lap and hysteroscopy are done together. I can't take birth control or any type of hormonal medication due to another condition so there's nothing I can do in the meantime. It is only getting worse. \n\nI also lose my parents' health insurance next year which means getting approved for any kind of surgery will be much more difficult. \n\nI don't know how to ask about it. I'm worried that like usual I won't be taken seriously. I'd really like to meet with the actual gynecologist and not her PA but of course they send all the new patients to her instead. A lot of doctors  don't believe me about not being able to take birth control. \n\nDid any of you outright ask your doctor for a lap? What kinds of things are important to mention? How do you get people to take you seriously? I'm so, so tired of fighting this same exhausting battle every month. \n",

        "body": "And it makes me sick. And I don't know what to do or if there's anything I can do.\n\nThey started dating a couple years ago, in our junior year at university. Not long after, she changed. She went from being happy and focused and social to being withdrawn and panicky all the time. She would have crying fits and panic attacks at school. I thought maybe the stress of her classes was getting to her. I never put it together.\n\nLater on she gradually began to reveal that he was abusing her and I started to see it happen in real-time. As she began to pull away from him, he was enraged, and he began stalking her and sending her threatening messages about showing up at her house and her classes. She ended up breaking down to a professor who was obligated to report the whole thing. \n\nAfter that I learned more about the extent of his abuse. I learned that he was isolating her from friends and family. I learned that he was lying to her and telling her that her friends talked about her behind her back. I learned that he ignored her boundaries during a sexual encounter - he assaulted her. I learned that he threatened to hit her. I saw the manipulative texts he sent where he hinted at being suicidal anytime she tried to pull away from him, I saw the messages he sent when he was stalking her. Seeing how truly devastated she was, and reading those texts, I have no doubt that she is telling the truth.\n\nUnfortunately the school did very little. They were not able to conclude anything regarding her case against him for sexual assault, but they did accept her texts and emails from him as evidence for stalking and gave him a sort of class-based restraining order where he wasn't allowed to be in the same building with her during her classes. \n\nI don't know if the actual police were involved. I think they were at one point, but she didn't get very far with them. I haven't asked about it because it was ultimately her decision. I don't think she felt she had a very strong case since there wasn't much evidence regarding the assault, though she certainly had a strong case against him for stalking. Either way I don't think she wanted to press charges, she just wanted him out of her life and to escape from her trauma.\n\nAnyway. He's now doing student teaching through the university at a middle school. He's an education major. He wants to work with kids. That's just great. \n\nI also found out from a friend that he has a profile on the site fet life where he describes being interested in daddy dom/little girl roleplaying. \n\nI'm not one to kink shame. I have some pretty fucked up kinks of my own. I keep them to myself, and there's nothing wrong with him wanting to consensually explore those kinks. Except he has a track record of not caring much about consent or respect. Also did I mention he's going to be a teacher.\n\nI don't even know what to do in this situation or if there's anything I can do. Part of me wants to screenshot his fet life profile and send it to the public school district, but I know that may not accomplish anything and it could actually hurt my friend. But it also disturbs me deeply to know that this sick piece of shit, who raped my friend and stalked her and treated her like dirt, wants to work with children, and also happens to have a kink that involves roleplaying children. The whole situation is just so fucked up.\n\nI don't even know what I'm looking for here. I just needed to get that off my chest. ",

Due to another condition I have to avoid birth control and any other hormonal drugs so doctors have just been kind of shrugging at me for years. \n\nFinally I went to the ER earlier this year for abdominal pain and they found what they said was a small fibroid on a CT scan. Then I went to the gyn for a transvaginal ultrasound and they confirmed the presence of the fibroid along with a polyp and numerous ovarian cysts, diagnosing me with PCOS. They decided to schedule me for a lap at my request and said they could also remove the fibroid with Acessa, for which an MRI was needed. The MRI strangely showed no fibroid though, so they decided to cancel that part of the procedure. \n\nSo Tuesday I had my surgery. My surgeon isn't necessarily a *specialist* in endo but she did say if she found any that it would be excised. Turns out she found nothing. I have my post-OP in a couple weeks so we can go over the results in detail but I'm feeling so unbelievably disheartened. I had really, really hoped I might be able to get some answers and maybe some relief but I feel like I'm just back at square one all over again. My pain isn't totally debilitating but it's bad enough to cause me to miss work and school, and it's bad enough that it interferes with my life and has caused me to miss work/school.\n\nDo you think I should get a second opinion? I guess the next best thing I can do in the meantime is see if I can get my PCOS under control and then I'll be able to tell if that's what is causing these problems. But if doesn't help, I don't even know what to do. There are no Nook specialists in my state, nor is there anyone in the sidebar link.

        "body": "Massive content warning for suicide, though that kind of goes without saying with this episode.\n\nA few years ago I (sort of, half-heartedly) attempted suicide in a very similar way to BoJack.\n\nIt didn't start out as a suicide attempt. There was no plan to hurt myself at the beginning of the evening. But there was alcohol. It already felt like everything in my life was falling apart, and then some other factors I won't get into came into place that truly drove the nail into the coffin and killed whatever hope I had that things could get better. So what started out as drinking for fun by myself turned into just drinking, and drinking. \n\nThe thing is, I never did that. I hated being so drunk that I felt like I couldn't control myself. So this was the first time in my life that I'd ever really let go like this, and the alcohol hit me *hard*. Eventually my drinks became less juice and more gin, until I started just drinking gin straight from the bottle until I was stumbling around my apartment alternating between laughing and crying. I was fucking *gone*, and I was consumed by a sense of total hopelessness and absolute certainty that things could never get better for me. \n\nThings start to get hazy here, but at some point I remembered I had a few pain pills stowed away. There were enough that I could risk some serious damage, if not death, but it wasn't a guarantee. Either way, I figured, I wanted this night to end, so I swallowed them down with another gulp of gin.\n\nI don't remember much of what happened next, but I do remember at some point I called the suicide hotline. The first time I called I couldn't speak, so I lay there on the floor just staring at my phone listening to the operator asking if I was there. The second time I called I managed find words to describe what was happening. I somehow had the presence of mind not to tell them about the pills, only that I was very drunk and sad and alone. I don't remember what was said, but I know the woman I spoke to was comforting and told me how to take care of myself for the rest of the night, so I wrapped myself up in a blanket to watch TV on the floor. \n\nEventually I threw up what felt like everything I'd ever eaten, which I'm guessing included the pills. I don't think they were in my system for very long. I woke up the next morning with the worst hangover of my life, but I was alive nonetheless. \n\nSo, back to BoJack. I binged the finale last night with my friend and was kind of too dumbstruck to really react to it at the time. It took until this morning for this episode to really hit me, and when it did I started sobbing. I think what really gutted me the most was BoJack's desperate phone call to Diane, begging her to save him and realizing it was too late, but not wanting to die alone. That's what I felt that night, when I called the suicide hotline. I just really didn't want to die alone. \n\nIt's just crazy to me because like I said, suicide was not my goal at the beginning of that evening. And I don't think that was BoJack's goal at the beginning of his evening, either. But alcohol, depression, and hopelessness are a deadly combination. I'm glad BoJack made it out alive, and I'm also glad that I made it out alive to see BoJack make it out alive. \n\nAnyway, I know this is mostly just about me and my problems, but I thought I'd share that. I don't think a show or movie has ever so closely depicted my experience with and feelings about suicide. I feel simultaneously extremely validated and understood, and very glad that I didn't go through that door.",

It started with urgency and frequency, and within a day progressed to burning and a fever as it started spreading to my kidneys. A week later after some Keflex and Macrobid I was feeling about 90% better. But I still had some discomfort in my urethra. I just didn't feel \"right.\" \n\nOver the next few months I found myself getting up to pee at night a lot, but I didn't think much of it. Then, out of the blue a few days before my period one night, I had an episode of indescribable pelvic pain very different from anything I've experienced. It was right above my pubic area and felt like an immense pressure that wouldn't go away. I wondered if it was an ovarian cyst, as I have PCOS. After some Tylenol I was able to sleep.\n\nA few weeks later, the urgency and frequency returned with a vengeance. I felt like I had to pee pretty much constantly even right after peeing and my urethra started to just randomly spasm. Eventually I started having hesitancy and having to strain to pee as well.\n\nI did a virtual appointment and got Macrobid, too scared to go into a clinic because of my immunocompromised sister. Was allergic to the Macrobid, switched to Bactrim. I've now been on the Bactrim for several days and I'm not sure if it's helping. The frequency and urgency are a lot better but my bladder feels sore and the hesitancy/weak stream is still there. I wonder if all my muscles are just tense and angry. It doesn't help that my period is due any day now. \n\nAnyway... of course I've been researching my symptoms obsessively and my anxiety brain has come to the conclusion that this is IC. It seems like this is how it starts for so many people - a nasty or recurrent UTI, then suddenly unrelenting pain and urgency. \n\nThe idea of adding another incurable pain condition to my list is unbearable. I already have IBS, PCOS, a neurological condition that's in remission, and primary dysmenorrhea. I had surgery in October to check for endometriosis and nothing was found. I'd started to accept that my horrific periods and my bowel issues are just part of my life, and now it feels like life is throwing me yet another curveball. I can't live with the entire lower half of my body being a massive garbage fire all the time. I don't get to poop normally, I don't get normal periods, and now I can't pee normally either. \n\nI know it's way too soon to jump to conclusions. I haven't even had a culture yet, let alone any other tests. But I'm so scared. I'm already significantly limited by my other conditions. I can't imagine adding yet another. \n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, but I just need some comfort.

        "body": "I was supposed to fly to visit my sister a few months ago. AA canceled my flight and I decided to get a one-way flight with SW since it was cheaper. I got an email instructing me to call AA when I was ready to rebook.\n\nI'm going to go home soon so I called rebooking. I was told I had $235 in credit. I asked if I could apply that to a first class seat and was told they can't upgrade even though I was not the one who canceled the flight. That puts me in a frustrating position because the rest of that money would go to waste, as I'm not flying again anytime soon. I was also really hoping for first class because it would allow me to social distance a bit more.\n\nSo I requested a refund on the site. I deliberately declined the voucher and selected that I just wanted a refund. But then on my confirmation page I noticed a green box with a check that said \"voucher\" and nothing on the page indicating what kind of refund I'm getting. \n\nNow I'm stuck, because I don't know how I'm getting my refund. If I get a voucher, then I need to wait until it's processed so I can use it, but if it's not a voucher, I can  just go ahead and buy my ticket now. I really want to fly back by the end of next week. Had I known I wouldn't be able to use my full credit for the seat I want I would've just requested a refund weeks ago.\n\nI've tried calling and can't get through to an actual person. When I clicked on the email link for \"refunds\" it just directed me back to the home page. The status just says \"pending review.\" Is there any way I can find out what kind of refund I'm getting or is there a way to get in touch with someone in refunds?",

        "body": "At the beginning of the COVID crisis, I went on a LOA at work and flew to stay with my sister for a little while. We figured that I would be safer isolating with her and my BIL who could take care of me and provide any resources I might need if things got really ugly. The plan was for me to stay a couple weeks, but then it became a month, then two, then three. \n\nThere were ups and downs. There were times where I found myself longing to go home, where I was annoyed at the lack of quiet and privacy I usually had by myself. And of course it was scary, because we were in the middle of a major crisis. \n\nBut it was also the happiest and healthiest I've been mentally in a very long time. I had a routine, I ate regular meals. I bonded with their sweet perfect dog and we all laughed and smiled every day. We watched TV and movies together, we played video games. It was wonderful. \n\nFor so long I've been convinced that I need (and deserve)  to live alone because I had a falling out with a close friend/roommate around 6 years ago. I decided to move to a studio apartment and I adapted to being on my own, but I was never really happy, just going through the motions. Being with my family for 3 months made me realize I am not only capable of living with others but that it's better for me and it makes me happy. \n\nI've been crying a lot since I came home and my heart feels so empty. I just want my family. Life is so short and I feel like I've been wasting mine in isolation.",

I wish I had more quantifiable achievements to list but I don't really get that kind of feedback from leadership at my work. \n\nI'm also unsure about my education section. I've read some conflicting advice as to whether to include incomplete college degrees. On the one hand, I think it's definitely a plus because it suggests that I have basic computer skills, etc. On the other hand the fact that it's incomplete doesn't exactly look good. I've also read that if the highest degree of education requested is a high school diploma then it's better to just leave off college education altogether. So, I don't know. Would I be better off just leaving it off?",

Twice now I've been to the ER for pelvic pain because doctors were worried about appendicitis, only to be told it may or may not be an ovarian cyst. \n\nIt's happening again. A few days ago I started having an IBS flare. Gas, mild diarrhea, can't eat anything except soup and plain bagels. I've had a weird bloating feeling off and on. And now I'm having a sharp, aching pain in my lower right pelvic area that comes and goes.\n\nI can't tell if there's rebound tenderness because it hurts when I press on it and continues to hurt afterward. But it's not like the kind of pain that makes you want to jump, it's just the same pain that I'm already feeling. No nausea, vomiting, fever. And the pain feels way lower than most people describe with appendicitis, like more in my pubic area probably where my uterus/ovaries are. I'm in the middle of my cycle so it could be ovulation. I'd give it a 3-4/10, not excruciating but difficult to ignore. Tylenol isn't helping.\n\nAnyway I have no idea what to do. Because of my asthma and obesity I'm at a slightly higher risk for COVID complications, so going to the ER could be dangerous for me. My gyn's office is closed now. Urgent care won't do anything, they have a policy that they won't treat any abdominal pain and will send you to the ER. I feel trapped. It's probably my ovaries being stupid again but I don't have any way to know for sure.",

I've been living alone away from my parents for several years, although I do receive some financial support from them, which I listed on my FAFSA.

But I'm glad that I got to spend those 3 months with her. I'll be forever grateful for the time we spent together.\n\nFuck cancer. Fuck 2020. [I love you Asgard](https://i.imgur.com/kxgFPDD.jpg).",

Someday I'd like to adopt a dog of my own.\n\nBut feeling this grief now, I'm starting to wonder, how do you open your heart up to an animal knowing that they will die long before you do? How do you move on from the loss of a beloved pet and go on to adopt new pets knowing that it's going to be the same thing again and again? My heart is so broken. I long to have the companionship of a pet, but just knowing that they won't be around for long is so sad. I'm sure that the love you share with your pet is worth the heartbreak, but it comes at such a great price.",

        "body": "No really. It gets better. Way fucking better. \n\nI just got a new job at a call center scheduling medical appointments. I have consistent hours, a decent pay rate, and good benefits. I'm allowed to have food and drinks at my desk. I get a full hour for lunch Weds-Friday. I can look at my phone as long as I'm not on a call. Everyone wears masks. And my managers treat me like an actual adult. They even check with me if they want to change my schedule. \n\nLast week I had a patient who was very angry that I couldn't magically make an appointment appear for her in October when we're already scheduling to the end of November. She started yelling, calling me names, typical Karen shit. She talked to my manager. My manager assured me that I did everything right and I had a laugh about it with one of my coworkers. I had a couple other shitty patients that day. Everyone just seemed to be in a foul mood. \n\nThat was probably the worst day I've had at my new job and it wasn't even bad. I have not had a single day so far that even compares to the bullshit that I dealt with at Target. The impossible-to-meet expectations, the micromanaging, the constant pressure, the shitty customers. I used to have panic attacks at work because of all the stress. The lack of hours definitely didn't help with my stress levels either. \n\nI had to call out once at my new job because of a chronic illness flare and several people actually checked in with me when I got back to see if I was feeling better. I can't wrap my head around how much better I'm treated here, but at the same time it's sad to realize just how poorly treated retail workers are when basic human decency is a major improvement.\n\nAnyway, my new job isn't perfect, but it's in a whole new league. For anyone trying to get out of Target right now, it might take some time to find a new job especially with the recession, but I can assure you there are workplaces out there that are sooooo much better. And you are not crazy or weak if you think Target is a difficult place to work because it absolutely fucking is. Keep searching and sending out those resumes.",

When i was in Kindergarten, I got \"engaged\" to a boy I was friends with. We kissed in secret behind the bushes once. \n\nWhen I was around 10, I had my first crush on a girl, one of my friends who rode the bus with me. \n\nWhen I was 12, I had my first real kiss with a close female friend of mine, and we experimented with each other for a few months. \n\nWhen I was 15, I fell head over heels in love with my female best friend. I briefly had a crush on a male friend, and another female friend.\n\nWhen I was 20, I fell in love with a nonbinary friend who I met online and had been talking to for years.\n\nI am definitely not asexual, nor aromantic. And yet, my attempts at dating have all been pretty unsuccessful. When a nice boy took me on a few dates at 17, I told him things weren't working out. When a very attractive guy at my university took me on a date and we fooled around at his place, I drifted away from him because I felt awkward and confused. When I joined Tinder to meet girls, several gorgeous ladies matched with me but I couldn't bring myself to meet up with any of them. It just didn't feel right. \n\nI've always been afraid to come out because my sexuality seemed so inconsistent. And to make matters all the more confusing, I do have kinks and sexual fantasies about all genders. So if I was a lesbian, why was I masturbating to solo male porn and fantasizing about getting fucked by a guy? Why didn't I want to go on a date with a pretty woman who wanted to date me? If I was bi or pan, then why did I feel so weird literally every time I went on a date with a guy? And if I was asexual, why did I have these secret fantasies about one of my dearest friends?\n\nTurns out there's a name for what I am - demisexual. \n\nSo I came out today. I'm so relieved that I've finally found a name for who I am, and to know that I am not alone. I'm not socially inept - I'm just not the kind of person who can meet someone and start a relationship with them right away. It might take a long time before I find someone to love, if I ever do, but that's okay. This is just who I am.",

For 3 months my entire camera roll was just pictures of her. She brought me so much joy during a scary time. \n\nI'm having a hard time processing it. Partly because I didn't get to be there when she passed, partly because she wasn't *my* dog. This isn't the first time I've been through this. When I was a kid my mom's friend had a sweet dog who I became friends with. Every day after school my mom and her friend would chat on the porch while me and Coco played in the yard. And then one day she got into something poisonous in the neighbor's garage (I think antifreeze) and that was it. My little heart was broken.\n\nNow my heart is broken again. I've been crying on and off all day. When I first found out about her diagnosis I had a few days where I was devastated and couldn't stop crying, but I dried up for a couple weeks. Now it's all come flooding back. \n\nI just want to know, is this normal? To be this heartbroken for someone else's dog? Even though she wasn't mine I loved her so much.

Not to mention several of my providers do not take my work's health plan. Someday I'll be able to work full time and afford the health plan, but that wasn't a bridge I was ready to cross yet. I don't know that my employer would allow me to work fewer hours. \n\nIs anyone else in the same boat? I 1000% think that the minimum wage needs to be increased but there are so many people who would lose their benefits, and the alternatives available to them may not be affordable. I really hope that states will consider raising the cutoff for benefits to reflect this change.",

I already have to do with people yelling at me because we're booking out so far, but we just found out last week that one of our doctors is moving out of state.\n\nWe had appointments booked for her into June. So that means we have like 200 appointments to reschedule for her. And because all of our other doctors are already booked to the max, we have nothing to offer them. So we have to tell people that scheduled their appointments in December that we won't be able to see them until July.\n\nIt's stressing me out so much that I feel a sinking dread every time I see a call come into the queue for that clinic, because all I have to offer is bad news. And the thing is, a lot of our patients don't have the option to go somewhere else. We're one of the few practices in town that accepts all Medicaid/Medicare plans, and a lot of patients depend on us for specialized care they can't get elsewhere, so they don't have a choice. \n\nI just hate having to constantly deliver bad news and tell people that I have nothing to offer them.

My hands shake. I feel like I can't breathe.\n\nI was conditioned to feel like this when someone is angry around me. Because it happened again and again and again. Because I dealt with my mother's explosive fits of rage on a near daily basis. It wasn't physical, except once. I just wish that she could've been consistent, instead of swinging back and forth between showering me in praise and affection, and then screaming at me that I was a terrible, selfish person the moment I said something wrong. Walking on eggshells 24/7, never knowing what was going to set her off or what was the right or wrong thing to do, having to listen to her scream at my dad and my sister from the other room.

But of course there are always people who can't be satisfied, who won't take no for an answer. Today I had one of those callers. He was angry that he couldn't get an exam in less than a month when we've been scheduling out 3-4 months in advance since the beginning of the pandemic. I got so overwhelmed I had to put him on hold to catch my breath and work up the courage to talk to him again. He hung up before I could get back to him. \n\nI'm planning on going into an administrative healthcare role, one where I won't have much patient interaction.

I've made so much progress, in so many ways, but I still shrink up and feel like a cornered, frightened little girl the moment someone starts to raise their voice.

But in the interest of treating my disease before it gets worse and avoiding the other medication, this could be a big help. I can always discuss it with my PCP too, but I'm also worried about her, as she's a nurse practitioner who doesn't seem to have a lot of knowledge about these kinds of things and she may not feel comfortable prescribing something like this.

        "body": "I just got my 2nd Moderna dose last week so I figured I would share my experience now that I'm on the other side of it. \n\nI ended up having side effects with both doses, but the first one wasn't as bad as the second. With my first dose, I experienced some pretty nasty arm soreness around 12 hours after the dose. Felt like I'd been bitten by a snake or hit with a baseball bat and it made it painful to sleep on that side. The next day I developed a low-grade fever and felt really tired. Tylenol helped a LOT with the arm soreness but had little effect on my fever. By around 48 hours after the first dose I felt completely back to normal.\n\nThe second dose on Wednesday last week was pretty rough. I started experiencing the arm soreness pretty much right away, so I took Tylenol early on this time. Within about 6 hours of getting the vaccine I had a fever around 100-101. My fever peaked in the middle of the night at 102.4 and I had chills so bad that my teeth started chattering when I got out from under my blankets. My muscles were very sore and weak and I had a hard time walking. I also felt a little sick to my stomach. When I was able to take my next dose of Tylenol my temperature dropped back a degree and my chills got a lot better. Some phenergan helped with the nausea and helped me get some decent sleep. I had some pretty bizarre fever dreams. \n\nThe next day I pretty much just slept and watched TV. My fever continued to fluctuate between 100.5 and 101.8, and the chills came back periodically whenever my temperature started to spike. My muscles were still pretty weak but a little less achy. I had absolutely no appetite and couldn't make myself eat anything except for popsicles, though the nausea was gone. \n\nThe next day I was supposed to work but called in because I was still totally wiped out and running a low fever around 100.4. I continued to rest. I tried to eat some bread with a garlic butter spread and this made my bowels very angry, so I had to take my IBS medication. Thankfully it stopped and I didn't have diarrhea. \n\nBy Saturday morning I felt almost completely better, though my bowels were still a bit fussy and I had to eat pretty lightly. Today I was more tired than usual after work and took a long nap, but other than that I'm pretty much back to normal though.\n\nOverall it wasn't so bad. The second dose was rough, but it's nothing I haven't dealt with before. I used to get pretty frequent viral infections as a kid so I'm pretty used to it. The best thing you can do is make time for yourself to rest for 2-3 days afterward just in case. Make sure to hydrate, try to eat if you can, and take Tylenol and/or ibuprofen for pain or fever. Although it isn't pleasant, these side effects are a sign that your immune system is doing its job.",

Ended up having to quit the stimulants because they made my anxiety worse. \n\nNow my anxiety is pretty well-managed with Paxil and I'm re-starting Wellbutrin, mostly because I'd like to have a little more energy and try to lose weight, which Wellbutrin helped with before. Instead of the XL version, though, my doctor wanted me to start with 75 mg IR and work my way up to taking that twice a day to avoid side effects.\n\nInterestingly, the expected side effects like insomnia and increased anxiety are not happening. Within 30 minutes or so of taking each dose I actually start feeling drowsy. It's not to the point that it's unbearable, but it's enough that I feel the need to take a nap. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this reaction? I can't tell if it's because I'm using a different version/manufacturer of the drug, because I'm using it alongside a different SSRI, because it's been a long time and my brain chemistry may have changed, or because I have ADHD and sometimes stimulating drugs can actually have the opposite effects on people with ADHD. It's just confusing for me because it didn't have this effect when I tried it before. I'm wondering if switching to the 150mg XL version would make it better or worse.",

My mind wanders and I have to reread paragraphs or even multiple pages because I haven't absorbed any of it. And it's just mentally taxing for me - after reading for a long time, my brain feels tired, the way it does after a difficult math assignment. \n\nSometime in my late teens I stopped reading for fun. I got too busy with school to have the time or energy for it. In college I never read for fun - I had enough *not fun* reading to do as it was and my brain couldn't handle any more of it. But after I dropped out I never picked up the habit again. \n\nI know a lot of people my age are in the same boat. It's not just an ADHD thing. I think social media has changed the way our attention works - we're used to instant gratification and short, readable paragraphs. Having to commit to a longer text seems daunting and unappealing. But I really *miss* reading. I miss getting lost in stories and crying at the end of a great book, making up stories in my head about the characters. There have been many attempts to start reading again, but a lot of the time I fail, because my brain feels tired enough most of the time and I just don't have it in me.\n\nRecently I started listening to audiobooks. I thought I wouldn't like it - I retain information even less when I listen to it. But something about fiction audiobooks just works for me and my brain. I can occupy myself with other tasks while I \"read,\" whether that's playing a mindnumbing game on my phone or doing a chore. The part of my brain that gets restless is occupied while other parts of my brain enjoy the story. Surprisingly I'm not having trouble keeping up with it at all, either. If I zone out and miss a part, I can tap a button that takes me back 30 seconds, or scroll back to wherever I remember leaving off, and somehow it feels so different from having to reread things, so much easier. I also just love hearing the voice of a narrator, hearing how they do the voices for the characters. It's a whole new experience for me. \n\nI've listened to three books this month and I'm honestly feeling emotional about it. I've missed this *so much* and I am so happy to have found my way back to it. Out of curiosity I did some research, too, and it turns out that our brains process audiobooks essentially the same way they do text, so it really doesn't make a difference. There are certainly advantages to reading, but when you're reading for fun, that doesn't really matter. Listening to an audiobook still counts. And it's fun. And I'm going to keep doing it. Maybe I'll work up to actual reading, too, because I'd like to have the patience to do that as well. But for now, this is awesome, and I am so happy to have rediscovered this part of myself.",

I was on Wellbutrin a while back for a few months but had to stop because it was triggering my anxiety. Now that I'm on Paxil my anxiety is more well-controlled and I seem to be tolerating the Wellbutrin a lot better.\n\nOne thing I am noticing is that I'm having more tics. It's still not at a point that it's disruptive or even noticeable to anyone else. But it makes me nervous. My health anxiety is starting to kick into gear, because I remember reading that Wellbutrin can rarely cause a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia which is usually caused by antipsychotics, so now when I have tics I start getting worried that they're going to evolve into something more serious. I know I have no rational evidence for this and it's the anxiety talking, but it's making me hyper aware of my tics and I'm focusing too much on them (which, ironically, triggers them even more.)\n\nHas anyone else had this experience with a medication? For what it's worth, pretty much anything stimulating seems to be a tic trigger for me. Caffeine triggers my tics, too, and when I tried ADHD meds they did as well. Wellbutrin is definitely a more stimulating drug so it's not all that surprising. I just tend to overthink these kinds of things.",

The combination of taking classes and working the 25 hours last semester definitely put me at my limit - if I had been working full-time I don't think I would have done as well in my classes.\n\nBut now, I'm trying to move. And the sad reality is, the cost of housing in my city has skyrocketed in the past year, and I can't ask my parents to support me forever and eventually I'm going to have to start paying for everything myself, which means I'm gonna have to go full-time.\n\nI dread it. So much. It's partly the job - I work in a scheduling call center. Most of my days consist of being grouched at about things that are out of my control, and aside from that it's just mind-numbing, tedious work. My managers are actually really great, the pay and benefits are pretty good. It's perfect in every way except that it's mentally and emotionally exhausting. The idea of trying to do this for 40 hours a week makes me want to cry. \n\nSure, maybe I could look for another job - and I plan to, once I have my degree/certification - but even then, it's going to be a lot more of the same thing every day with just a couple days off in between and a few rare vacations and then I get old and die.\n\nWhat's the point? I miss having the time and energy to do things I enjoy. I'm already so tired. If this is what adult life is supposed to be then I don't understand how everyone doesn't just end it eventually.",

        "body": "I gotta type this up before I forget all the details. I just had a dream that I and some other people were at the airport about to board this giant aircraft designed by Elon Musk that was also partly underwater. It was docked in a river and we were scheduled to ride it for its first launch. The interior looked kind of like a university lecture hall, with a rows of seats in a kind of curved formation. We were all sitting and getting situated when the flight attendants and crew suddenly started acting strangely, whispering to each other and rushing around. Suddenly they started pulling people who they claimed had to deplane due to the craft exceeding its weight limit.\n\nNaturally people were getting pretty nervous at this point, and me and my family decided we would like to deplane as well because we didn't feel safe, but the crew was trying to stop us from leaving. Eventually I ran past them through a door and through several hallways filled with fancy-looking aircraft tech and blinking lights, and my family and I made it back into the airport just in time to see a geyser of water shoot up as part of the aircraft exploded. The whole place was shaking and tilting. People inside the craft were drowning as the cabin flooded with water, trying to climb over the chairs and climb the walls to escape.\n\nAt the same time outside, people were fleeing from the airport, but they were being snatched up and killed by \"smart nodes\", these weird floating machines that looked kind of like evil robot sperm. Supposedly they maintained the aircraft's power source and performed maintenance, and there were thousands of them in the water. If anyone got too close, they would detect their movements and shoot barbed cords out of the water to catch them.\n\nSo now there was the dilemma of trying to escape the airport before the whole aircraft explodes, while getting past the smart nodes. Outside people had started to devise a strategy that involved swimming across the river at measured intervals where the smart nodes wouldn't detect them, but it wasn't fool proof and every time they did this the smart nodes would kill a couple people. My family and the group of people with us decided instead to search for an escape pod on the second floor of the airport. Also at one point Elon Musk decided to address everyone in the airport, showing up on all the screens. He claimed everything was normal and asked for everyone to just stay calm and stay inside. \n\nThat was about as far as it got before I woke up. What a strange dream.",

Sadly they are discontinued and the most recent line of 1080's has some mixed reviews so I'm reluctant to shell out the money for them. \n\nI also have wide feet, so that kind of narrows my options a bit.

Due to long wait times, we give patients the option to receive a call back, and this particular queue doesn't have a way to route calls by location so it's just for all of them. \n\nThe call connects, and what do you know, it's Stubborn Lady.\n\nMe: Hi, this is tomorrowistomato calling you back from My Workplace, how can I help you today?\n\nSL: tomorowistomato???

I've been there about a year, and while I've definitely gotten better at handling angry patients who are just being rude and unreasonable, I do struggle immensely with patients who are angry for a completely justifiable reason. It makes me feel like absolute shit that there's nothing I can do to help them and it makes me so anxious that I sometimes put them on hold for minutes because I can't bring myself to talk to them knowing that my hands are tied. Sometimes I start crying and it's so hard to keep my voice steady. \n\nI've been having this issue a lot with one of our clinics in particular. There have been problems with messages for symptomatic patients not being triaged, so patients will literally call us for serious medical problems and no one fucking calls them back, and then it's the call center staff who have to deal with it when they call back days later wondering why no one has gotten back to them. And then we put them on hold for 10-15 minutes only to be told by the clinic that no one is available and they'll call the patient back later. Recently they also cancelled almost 100 appointments for one of the doctors because they're pulling him to help in a specialty clinic that just lost a doctor, but they've offered absolutely no recourse. Patients who've been waiting to see this doctor for months are now being told that they have to wait another 3 months to see him, while other patients who were scheduled for the same days still get to keep their appointments since they were in unaffected time slots. It's just a huge fucking mess and I'm so over it, and it's gotten to the point that I'm filled with dread every time a call for that clinic comes up on the queue. \n\nI get that I have it pretty easy as far as call centers go. People in tech support, customer service, collections, etc. get to deal with people screaming at them and verbally abusing them all day. I'm lucky that the majority of my interactions with patients are pretty chill. But this is honestly making me dread coming to work. \n\nSo I guess my question is, does anyone have any guidance or advice on how to get better at breaking bad news to customers? How do you deal with the guilt and keep your emotions in check?",

My papilledema is now starting to gradually return, and my neuro-ophthalmologist wants me to focus first on trying to lose weight. But if that isn't enough, I may need to go back on the Diamox.\n\nThe thing is, I did not tolerate Diamox very well when I was on it. I would say it was one of the hardest things I've been through. It absolutely sucked the life out of me and I dread the thought of having to go back to that. I'm wondering, though, if starting a low dose of Diamox while things are still in the early stages might be enough to keep it at bay and help my pressure slowly return to normal. \n\nHas anyone had success with treatment at a lower dose? I think the highest I ever got was 1500 mg and that was enough to reduce my papilledema within about 8 months. If I could get away with taking like 500-750 mg per day I might actually be okay.",

My dad and I ran outside to evacuate, and then someone announced over the PA system to evacuate the park so everyone else started running too.\n\nWhile my dad and I were running we got separated in a crowd, but I still managed to find my way out of the park, which involved climbing up and down a lot of random stairs and running through empty shops. \n\nOutside the park they had set up a \"recovery center\" under this big white tent/pavilion that looked like it was set up for a wedding. I remember walking there feeling like I was in shock, and I remember I was suddenly wearing a wedding gown. Someone handed me an empty wine glass but it was so fragile it broke in my hand, and I started bleeding all over my dress. This somehow made me think of my father and wonder if he survived, so I began to cry. \n\nAnd then this blond woman decided to chastise me for crying, telling me to stop and saying that they were \"fake tears\" and that I \"should have finished crying hours ago\" and somehow brought this on myself. \n\nEnraged, I called her a cunt and threw the bloody shards of glass at her, and she made a huge scene. A Disney employee decided to take her side and permanently banned me from Disneyland. \n\nSo yeah, guess I'm dream banned from Disney now. Lowkey still mad about it.

My question is, what counts as written notice? Does my online tenant portal request count?

        "body": "Since I moved in *less than a month ago*, I have had to submit maintenance requests for 7 different problems. Some of them were small things easily fixed like a leaky faucet and a motor issue in the cooler.\n\nThe worst of the problems started last week when I noticed a faint gas smell in the kitchen by my water heater. I called the gas company and what do you know, it's a gas leak. Gas was shut off. I submitted my maintenance request and waited.\n\n3 days later I contacted the vendor my issue was assigned to and they apparently never received the work order. I contacted apartment management and they got them to send a plumber later that day. Unfortunately all the plumber could do was make an assessment of the repairs needed because it was a much bigger problem than he expected.\n\nIt's been a week. Still no hot water, no stove, no oven. They came out today to begin repairing the gas line but it's going to be a multi-day project that requires going into the ceiling.\n\nAs if it couldn't get any worse, I suddenly lost internet access today in the afternoon and discovered that all of the outlets connected to one breaker have stopped working. I tried every troubleshooting step I could but nothing is helping. So yet another request has been submitted. \n\nI'm about to lose my shit here. I am supposed to be working from home and have been coming into the office all week because I can't be disrupted if maintenance is going to be here. And now even if I wanted to work from home I can't. I don't have a car. Every Uber trip to and from the office costs money. \n\nI have no hot water, I can't use the stove or oven, no internet access (except the hotspot), and there is only 1 working outlet in my living room. Even the nastiest, sketchiest motels have those things.\n\nI don't have any legal recourse here as far as I can see. My lease is pretty much unbreakable. And I can't try to withhold rent because technically the landlord has responded to my requests and made repairs in a reasonable time frame, with the exception of the gas/water heater issue, which is being dealt with albeit slowly.\n\nEven if I could break my lease I have nowhere to go. The rental market in my city is a nightmare right now. I'm just so, so fucking tired. Half the reason I left my old apartment was because it was rundown with constant problems and the facility was very poorly maintained in general. I knew moving into this place that it wasn't going to be a luxury apartment but hey, if I'm gonna live in a crappy apartment it might as well be one with more space right? I wish I would've waited.",

I'm looking for a solution to completely block or cover all sound, not just reduce it.",

I really need to go grocery shopping.\n\nI don't have any clean dishes. \n\nI guess I can have some peanut butter and crackers. Not much of a meal.\n\nAs for the laundry... before I go to the laundry room I'll need to at least brush my hair and teeth, and hope no one comes in and sees how disgusting and grubby I am.\n\nOnce the laundry is done I still have to shower. Put on clean clothes. And then somehow I'm supposed to drag myself to the bus stop, to the pharmacy, and back home. Right now I can barely muster the strength to get up from my bed. It's going to be dark in a few hours and I don't have much time. \n\nI think it would be easier if I just went back to bed. I can try again tomorrow.\n\nGood night.",

        "body": "For those who haven't heard of this yet, ghost restaurants/kitchens are essentially virtual restaurants without a storefront, usually operating out of another restaurant. They offer delivery through apps like DoorDash, Ubereats, etc. Some of them are restaurants rebranding, some are chains trying to make themselves look like local businesses, and some are part of special promotions. A lot of people feel that this is deceptive while others feel that it's a smart marketing strategy. In any case, I think people deserve to know where their food is coming from (bearing in mind that some ghost kitchens may have suppliers not connected to the host restuarant), so I figured I'd make a list for the ones I know of in ABQ.

Things can get pretty bad and turn back around. There's no telling.

I've already had a lap to check for endo. I'm so frustrated. I know that you're *supposed* to go to the doctor when things like this happen, but what can you do when they won't listen? This is the second gynecologist I've seen in this city now who won't take no for an answer about hormonal treatment. \n\nI'm sorry if none of that made sense, I'm tired and stressed and know I'm rambling.

        "body": "I understand that people need glasses because of changes to the shape of the cornea. The cornea refracts light entering the eye and the lens focuses it so it produces a sharp, clear image when the light hits the retina, and if the shape of the cornea isn't just right that image will be less clear, so glasses adjust the refraction to compensate. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why using someone else's glasses or the wrong prescription creates that fishbowl effect where everything is distorted and depth perception is off. I could understand why it might look blurry if it's the wrong prescription, but why is it so distorted? And why doesn't it look that way for the other person?",

        "body": "I'm not diagnosed with autism yet but I'm working on it. I know I at the very least have a sensory processing disorder.\n\nFor my entire life I've struggled with clothing because of my sensory issues. As an adult 90% of my wardrobe is leggings, T-shirts, and sneakers. I only dress up if I have to for a special/professional occasion, but the rest of the time, all I care about is that my clothes are clean and comfortable. I also don't wear makeup and don't style my hair. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why this seems to bother people so much. They don't necessarily say anything to me directly, but I know the way people talk about these kinds of clothes. Childish, lazy, sloppy, the list goes on. And I just don't get it. Why is it so important for people to be fashionable? Maybe they don't find my clothes attractive, but what if I'm not trying to be attractive? Or some might say it's \"unprofessional\", but am I supposed to look professional outside of work? They might think it's immature, but why is it childish to want to be comfortable? \n\nI just don't understand why people seem to get so worked up about what other people are wearing. On the list of things that I care about it's pretty low. I guess I also don't really \"get\" fashion in general. I have a vague intuitive sense of what goes together and what doesn't, but it seems like there are so many rules and it's hard to keep up with the trends when they change so fast.",

He literally shares dozens of Facebook posts daily, about vaccines, the deep state, Biden, Big Pharma, the list goes on and fucking on. \n\nHe wasn't always like this. \n\nHe used to be a hippy. Pagan, actually. One of those New Agey crystal-loving types who does reiki and burns incense and believes in a bizarre amalgamation of various religions.\n\nHe brought me up in nature. We went hiking, biking, rafting, driving, sledding, all across the beautiful terrain surrounding my home town. We climbed sand dunes and conquered mountains. We explored mining towns and canyons. We hugged trees and watched clouds. \n\nI don't know what happened to him. I think he was lonely. He's never had many friends. Sometime in the past 10-15 years or so he started spending more time online. At first it was just following \"alternative medicine\" bloggers. Then it started to progress to conspiracy theories. The moon landing was faked, 9/11 was an inside job, vaccines cause autism. It was the anti-vaxx nonsense that really seemed to be the turning point for him. \n\nAnd he's been addicted ever since. It's all he wants to talk about. It's hard to have a normal conversation with him because he finds a way to divert every discussion toward whatever nonsense theory is trending this week. It's like it's consumed his entire personality and he's become this bitter, cynical shell of the person he used to be. \n\nI miss him so fucking much that I'm afraid to let myself cry about it because I don't know when I'll stop. I miss the dad who taught me about love and kindness. The dad who made me pancakes and had a special song he made up just for me when I was little. He's never been perfect. Maybe this is who he always was, and I just never saw it because I was young and ignorant. But I swear, there used to be someone in there with a personality, whose entire world didn't revolve around conspiracy bullshit. \n\nI just want my dad back.",
