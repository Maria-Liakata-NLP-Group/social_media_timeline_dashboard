Female. \n\nI started drinking at age 21 while in a toxic abusive relationship with another alcoholic. At first I used it as a crutch to numb all the pain I was feeling but once I got out of that relationship the drinking just got worse. I would drink when I remembered the bad times....it didn't help but I used being drunk as an excuse to be stupid. I am now in a healthy relationship and I am so embarrassed of my problem. Every time I try to quit I relapse. Last night I told myself I would only have 2 drinks... I remember after finishing my second drink I went to the whisky bottle. I remember having a few swigs. this morning... I wake up and the bottle is just gone. Not empty I don't think...but just nowhere. No idea what I did with it. I also tend to sleepwalk and sleep eat. I am scared I sleep drank the whole bottle. For the record I sleepwalk sober and drunk. Just more so when I'm drunk.",

It was very hard to walk to the break room. I couldn't find anyone to cover my shift so I had to power through.... but every once in a while  I would have these weird contracting spasms on the right half of my face.  This is normal ish with my migraines, but it was particularly bad this time.  Gradually the tremors would come and go but they were primarily on my right side. Could I have been having small seizures? By the end d of the night I was basically in so much pain that I kin d of had to dissociate to keep from crying and or punching the wall. Once I made it home, i laid down and I couldn't move or speak without pain so I was just.... Like a vegetable. I made myself eat a bit and I took my night time meds for migraine and fell asleep eventually.  It was absolutely top 5 worst headaches of my life.  \n\nAnyone else get tremors or unstoppable facial spasms with their headaches???",

BACKSTORY TANGET TIME:\n I am 26 years old, in fairly good shape, but at 23 I started having chronic and severe back pain. It took a while, but eventually the doctors did an x-ray. Turns out I have ARTHRITIS in my lumbar spine. Found this out at age 24 I think. So that's not normal for someone my age / fitness level. Blood work - no rheumatic indicators. No antinuclear antibodies. For now it's \"not lupus\" but likely a connective tissue disorder - beighton scale test replicated 3x with the same results- super floppy and definitely worth looking into eds (it would literally answer all of my weird body things that I've dealt with all my life. ).\n\nBACKSTORY TANGENT OVER. \nSo my physiotherapist is super nice and validating. My pelvis, shoulders and spine are crooked in one way or another. At first, the 2 times a week appointments really seemed to be helping. I have been given exercises to kind of support my lower back. I do these every day. But the thing is... I don't have an actual diagnosis yet. And these appointments are 80 bucks a session. I have insurance through work, but that will eventually run out. I don't know if it's worth just paying out of pocket for if I am not getting the right kind of treatment for what I have. While all this is going on, I am also in the process of working a full time retail job and moving. It's super overwhelming. Anyone have advice or opinions on what my next move should be?",

I used all my energy to take a bath and brush my teeth.  My headache is slightly less awful, But my back hurts more.  I used my tens and my heating pad but that's not providing any lasting relief... and my ears are ringing.... and my vision is like tv static......all kinds of new bruises are just fucking appearing on my body.

But when I go to the doctor, \"nothing is causing it.\" I've never been tested for gastroparesis, looking back on it,  I have no fucking clue why. They did a barrium swallow and tilt test. They did an endoscopy and took tissue samples. But never bothered to connect my nausea and chronic constipation and difficulty swallowing. I didn't know gastroparesis was a thing until about a year ago. Maybe that's why I've had trouble swallowing pills and food??? For fucks sake. Doctors are so quick to say that you're paranoid. I am in real genuine pain. I have missed out on SO MUCH OF MY LIFE being sick. I've been judged by teachers and shunned by friends. I've had employers tell me that my illness is really inconvenient for them. Like. If you think it's annoying for you... stop and think. How the fuck do you think I feel???? I WANT to work. I WANT to be able to go to work and feel 100% okay. My pain and suffering is inconvenient for you? Fucking really? I am so tired. I almost want to just give up. May as well just let myself starve. Uh oh. But then they'll call me anorexic! Middle school flashbacks. Nothing is more confusing as a young teen than having the guidance counsellor tell you that you have an eating disorder when you don't. I want to eat. I really do. It's just not worth what I feel like afterwards.",

My grandmother just died a few days ago.... my sister is severely mentally ill and suicidal... I am so worried about my parents handling her along with the death of my mother's mom...

I do something like put a new set up together at work and I think it looks like garbage and no one else sees it. I clean the apartment and I see no difference but my boyfriend says I did a good job. My parents say they're proud of me. But I don't have a social life. I don't have friends at all. I have a boyfriend and a cat. I don't know what I'd do without them.

What will my family or boyfriend or cat or workplace do if I die? My sister would absolutely lose her mind. My parents likely wouldn't be far behind her. My cat would meow at my boyfriend asking where I went. My boyfriend would lose himself in fantasy games and probably go after a vice like drugs or alcohol to distract himself.
