        "body": "Hello, \n\nmy husband and I have been happily married almost 3 years now. However, I noticed some odd behaviors early onto our third year in. He started becoming colder to me. Started making excuses that his dick wasn't going to work anymore. Despite him getting boners just fine with me. He still complained that his dick just isn't working. Despite all that, we worked thru it. I let him sleep with other women in hopes that it might let him retain his self esteem and make him confident in his sexuality. \n\nAlthough, that was probably the breaking point. He started rejecting my advances. He no longer was interested in having sex with me. He went from making extravagant sexual adventures with me where I felt loved and adored. Now he rejects my sexual advances and will physically move to the other side of the room or the other side of the couch in an effort to not engage. I have to practically BEG to be touched and it's just a chore for him. He said touching me meant nothing more than fucking me to get off and then when he was done (If he could do it) it was just a bad feeling in the air. \n\nOne day he flat out said, I don't want to have sex anymore. I've decided. We are done. \n\nI walked out of the house in the middle of the night and now I'm here. At my vacation home. \n\nWhat would make a man just start hating the very existence of his wife? Someone he once loved and cared for and just throw her in the dump. Why is the male penis so targeted in needing NEW shiny things to get off instead of just getting off on love? I don't understand this behavior. Why is it some men don't have the capacity to link love and sex. And so they detest their partner and not openly communicate REAL reasons why. \n\nWhy can a woman love a man for over 15 years and do EVERYTHING RIGHT and treat him like a king and he just shits on her whole show of dedication, devotion and worship?  Are there really people born without hearts of loyalty. Without hearts at all? Please help me understand.",

        "title": "The King and The Ugly Duckling",
        "body": "Once upon a time there was a great king. He was a good to his people and the land was rich. No one was ever without food or healthcare. He made sure children were educated and flourished. And he was also, so good to women. Making sure they had equal or even MORE rights than men. Women and children highly protected under his rule. A great peaceful land it was...  \n\n\nHe loved women. He was what some would call a ladies man. A true Casanova whom you could not take your eyes off of. One day on one of his brisk walks with his dog down the alleyway, he spotted a poor peasant girl dressed in rags. He stared at her with warm eyes and a dimple that graced his cheek when he smiled. She could barely hold her gaze up to him as he was as wonderful and handsome as she heard in all the rumors. Her chest became heavy as he walked toward her and asked her if she would join him at his castle for some tea and biscuits.\n\nShe was nervous as she walked up the marble steps, she didn't have the fancy velvet attire the rest of the court wore. She was in complete awe in his home. He sat her at one end of the table and rather than have the help set the table, he was the one seen coming in and out of the kitchen with the finest foods he had constructed for her. A platter of cheeses, meats and breads. Tea's in served in fine china dinnerware. And rather than sit at the other end of the long table, he sat right next to her. Spoke with her all day and into the night.  She felt like a dim star that was discovered, by him.   \nThe next day, a courier brought her a beautiful tightfigting white gown that frayed out at the bottom and graced the floor. \"He likes his women to look this way\". The feeble bald headed courier told her. He then handed her a basket of treats that included a bottle of sweet french parfum. \"He likes his women to smell this way.\" Her eyes widened with glee. She had never been treated so elegantly in her whole life. \"he expect to see you at his castle tonight. oh, and by the way, he says you laugh far too loudly for his tastes. He also would like you to take this pill. It will make you more mature when you're around him. So that the both of you can articulate yourselves like the aristocrat's you are! toodaloo young lady.\"  \nAn old woman came rushing in and grabbed her face tightly, looking at all the crevices and angles her she was born with. She took the time to do her makeup and gave her a manicure and pedicure. The old woman waiting as she bathed herself in the oils that he sent. When she got out, the old women clasped her dress together on her and slipped her shoes upon her feet. \"you are now a swan, young lady\". She looked at herself in the mirror.   \nThe once ugly duckling had now started to look and feel like a beautiful elegant swan. She was in bliss.   \nShe spent many nights with the king. He shared with her his childhood memories. He showed her all the little trinkets around his home. They had become friends. He had a bedroom for love making. He would grace the white bed with rose petals for her. He made sure to wear his best cologne when they laid to rest for the still of the night. He made her rose petal baths and played with her. Like children they swam from one adventure to another upon the skin of the other. He treated the peasant girl, like she was his princess.   \nOne early morning, she left and saw another women, waiting at the bottom of his stairs. She gazed at her feeling uneasy. She went home. It was days before she would hear a summon for her to be present again in his quarters. Each time he summoned for her days apart, she saw a new woman, head bowed and waiting. She walked by them, never questioning them and never questioning him. What was she to do? Complain? How does one complain to a king who gives you everything? So she didn't. She ignored it.   \nUntil one day, days turned to weeks before she would hear from him. Her heart would crack with each quiet day, starved of his affection that she grew to hunger for. This new days to come, were unlike any of the others.   \nHe started to grow colder toward her. He wanted to do things to her, that he had never done before. He wanted to choke her when they made love. And when she didn't follow an order he gave her, he slapped her till she fell off the bed. He wanted other men in the kingdom to watch him as his 'princess' served him sexual favors. He let them peak thru the doors. Pervert men peeking in on what was suppose to be an intimate engagement.   \nShe mustered the courage to speak up and asked him about his peculiar behavior. \"How dare you question me! You're a smart enough girl. You know damn well I'm not going to ever going marry someone like. you. You know your place! You know what I do! In fact, I'm getting pretty tired of your attitude. I'm sick of touching you. You can come by from time to time, but the most I can offer you is to let you suck my dick!\"   \nThe fairy tale king who was god's gift to women, had shown his true character. His love for women, only reached so far. There was another side to him, that needed to indulge and feed. Women had to pay the piper.   \nThe 'princess' was no longer desirable to the king. He plucked each of her beautiful swan feathers from her slowly, one by one. Revealing her ugly duckling underneath it all.  \nHe laughed at her. A laugh so hard, it was louder than any other she had her come from herself. The laughs she precisely tried to control so that he would not be bothered. She stood there naked. Shaking. Her palms tight in a fist. What the king didn't know is that this ugly duckling had far too many unfortunate events by the hands of men in her lifetime. Oh yes, he was so good to her. But she was fed up. Her skin turned red. Her hair frizzed outward raised with the rage that started to fill her being.   \nShe marched out of the room. She found the parlor where the knights held their armor. She put on a chainmail over her front and buttocks. A bare long beautiful legs still visible. Slipped on the elbow length metal gloves. No mask. No helmet. Her hair was going to remain wild and visible for the events that were about to unfold. She grabbed the longest sharpest sword from the weapons cabinet. She marched down the hall. Her breasts still visible and bouncing as the help watched her stomp her way back to the kings room.   \nAnd there he was, outside his patio smiling and laughing with the girls outside his window. All of her anger from the day she was born to day, came from her core and powered her grip as she swung the sword with all her might across his neck. His severed head, fell 3 stories down into the lap of the maiden he was talking to. Blood dripped down her head and face and lap. She shrieked at the sight.   \nThe peasant girl put on all the kings jewelry and rings. She put on his beautiful velvet robe that graced the floor as she walked over to his cologne and sprayed herself all over. She laughed the loudest laugh she could. Cause she knew, he taught her the proper way to put that parfums on. And she didn't care. She reached the bottom of the stairs. The other girl was still shrieking in disbelief.   \nShe picked up the head from the girl and raised it high for the whole kingdom to see. Shaking it as blood sprayed everywhere. A crowd gathering to see the commotion.  \nI HAVE SET AN EXAMPLE TODAY. TODAY LIES A NEW DAY. NEVER AGAIN WILL A MAN RUN THIS COUNTRY. I AM NOW YOUR QUEEN!   \nWOMEN WILL RUN FREE AND NAKED!!  \nMEN ARE ORDERED TO PROTECT US. IF YOU HARM US, WE WILL SEE IMMINENT DEATH. MEN WILL HAVE ONE PURPOSE AND ONE PURPOSE ALONE. TO SERVE US WOMEN HOW WE DEMAND TO BE SERVED!! YOU'LL COOK, CLEAN, WORK, TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND PROVIDE US WITH THE SEXUAL INTIMACY WE DEMAND OF YOU.   \nAND IF YOU BECOME WORTHLESS AND REFUSE US, YOU WILL BE MET WITH THIS SAME DEMISE!!

        "title": "The King and The Ugly Duckling",
        "body": "Once upon a time there was a great king. He was a good to his people and the land was rich. No one was ever without food or healthcare. He made sure children were educated and flourished. And he was also, so good to women. Making sure they had equal or even MORE rights than men. Women and children highly protected under his rule. A great peaceful land it was...\n\nHe loved women. He was what some would call a ladies man. A true Casanova whom you could not take your eyes off of. One day on one of his brisk walks with his dog down the alleyway, he spotted a poor peasant girl dressed in rags. He stared at her with warm eyes and a dimple that graced his cheek when he smiled. She could barely hold her gaze up to him as he was as wonderful and handsome as she heard in all the rumors. Her chest became heavy as he walked toward her and asked her if she would join him at his castle for some tea and biscuits.\n\nShe was nervous as she walked up the marble steps, she didn't have the fancy velvet attire the rest of the court wore. She was in complete awe in his home. He sat her at one end of the table and rather than have the help set the table, he was the one seen coming in and out of the kitchen with the finest foods he had constructed for her. A platter of cheeses, meats and breads. Tea's in served in fine china dinnerware. And rather than sit at the other end of the long table, he sat right next to her. Spoke with her all day and into the night.  She felt like a dim star that was discovered, by him. \n\nThe next day, a courier brought her a beautiful tightfigting white gown that frayed out at the bottom and graced the floor. \"He likes his women to look this way\". The feeble bald headed courier told her. He then handed her a basket of treats that included a bottle of sweet french parfum. \"He likes his women to smell this way.\" Her eyes widened with glee. She had never been treated so elegantly in her whole life. \"he expect to see you at his castle tonight. oh, and by the way, he says you laugh far too loudly for his tastes. He also would like you to take this pill. It will make you more mature when you're around him. So that the both of you can articulate yourselves like the aristocrat's you are! toodaloo young lady.\"\n\nAn old woman came rushing in and grabbed her face tightly, looking at all the crevices and angles her she was born with. She took the time to do her makeup and gave her a manicure and pedicure. The old woman waiting as she bathed herself in the oils that he sent. When she got out, the old women clasped her dress together on her and slipped her shoes upon her feet. \"you are now a swan, young lady\". She looked at herself in the mirror. \n\nThe once ugly duckling had now started to look and feel like a beautiful elegant swan. She was in bliss. \n\nShe spent many nights with the king. He shared with her his childhood memories. He showed her all the little trinkets around his home. They had become friends. He had a bedroom for love making. He would grace the white bed with rose petals for her. He made sure to wear his best cologne when they laid to rest for the still of the night. He made her rose petal baths and played with her. Like children they swam from one adventure to another upon the skin of the other. He treated the peasant girl, like she was his princess. \n\nOne early morning, she left and saw another women, waiting at the bottom of his stairs. She gazed at her feeling uneasy. She went home. It was days before she would hear a summon for her to be present again in his quarters. Each time he summoned for her days apart, she saw a new woman, head bowed and waiting. She walked by them, never questioning them and never questioning him. What was she to do? Complain? How does one complain to a king who gives you everything? So she didn't. She ignored it. \n\nUntil one day, days turned to weeks before she would hear from him. Her heart would crack with each quiet day, starved of his affection that she grew to hunger for. This new days to come, were unlike any of the others. \n\nHe started to grow colder toward her. He wanted to do things to her, that he had never done before. He wanted to choke her when they made love. And when she didn't follow an order he gave her, he slapped her till she fell off the bed. He wanted other men in the kingdom to watch him as his 'princess' served him sexual favors. He let them peak thru the doors. Pervert men peeking in on what was suppose to be an intimate engagement. \n\nShe mustered the courage to speak up and asked him about his peculiar behavior. \"How dare you question me! You're a smart enough girl. You know damn well I'm not going to ever going marry someone like. you. You know your place! You know what I do! In fact, I'm getting pretty tired of your attitude. I'm sick of touching you. You can come by from time to time, but the most I can offer you is to let you suck my dick!\" \n\nThe fairy tale king who was god's gift to women, had shown his true character. His love for women, only reached so far. There was another side to him, that needed to indulge and feed. Women had to pay the piper. \n\nThe 'princess' was no longer desirable to the king. He plucked each of her beautiful swan feathers from her slowly, one by one. Revealing her ugly duckling underneath it all.\n\nHe laughed at her. A laugh so hard, it was louder than any other she had her come from herself. The laughs she precisely tried to control so that he would not be bothered. She stood there naked. Shaking. Her palms tight in a fist. What the king didn't know is that this ugly duckling had far too many unfortunate events by the hands of men in her lifetime. Oh yes, he was so good to her. But she was fed up. Her skin turned red. Her hair frizzed outward raised with the rage that started to fill her being. \n\nShe marched out of the room. She found the parlor where the knights held their armor. She put on a chainmail over her front and buttocks. A bare long beautiful legs still visible. Slipped on the elbow length metal gloves. No mask. No helmet. Her hair was going to remain wild and visible for the events that were about to unfold. She grabbed the longest sharpest sword from the weapons cabinet. She marched down the hall. Her breasts still visible and bouncing as the help watched her stomp her way back to the kings room. \n\nAnd there he was, outside his patio smiling and laughing with the girls outside his window. All of her anger from the day she was born to day, came from her core and powered her grip as she swung the sword with all her might across his neck. His severed head, fell 3 stories down into the lap of the maiden he was talking to. Blood dripped down her head and face and lap. She shrieked at the sight. \n\nThe peasant girl put on all the kings jewelry and rings. She put on his beautiful velvet robe that graced the floor as she walked over to his cologne and sprayed herself all over. She laughed the loudest laugh she could. Cause she knew, he taught her the proper way to put that parfums on. And she didn't care. She reached the bottom of the stairs. The other girl was still shrieking in disbelief. \n\nShe picked up the head from the girl and raised it high for the whole kingdom to see. Shaking it as blood sprayed everywhere. A crowd gathering to see the commotion.\n\nI HAVE SET AN EXAMPLE TODAY. TODAY LIES A NEW DAY. NEVER AGAIN WILL A MAN RUN THIS COUNTRY. I AM NOW YOUR QUEEN! \n\nWOMEN WILL RUN FREE AND NAKED!!\n\nMEN ARE ORDERED TO PROTECT US. IF YOU HARM US, WE WILL SEE IMMINENT DEATH. MEN WILL HAVE ONE PURPOSE AND ONE PURPOSE ALONE. TO SERVE US WOMEN HOW WE DEMAND TO BE SERVED!! YOU'LL COOK, CLEAN, WORK, TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND PROVIDE US WITH THE SEXUAL INTIMACY WE DEMAND OF YOU. \n\nAND IF YOU BECOME WORTHLESS AND REFUSE US, YOU WILL BE MET WITH THIS SAME DEMISE!! NO QUESTIONS ASKED. NO SECOND CHANCES. \n\nAnd from that day on, women in the kingdom were in total control. Men who tried to resist were met with instant death. Only the submissive men were allowed to live. \n\nAs time went by, there was no such thing as rape. There was no such thing as sexual violence. And dominate men were erased from the history books. World peace had been achieved at about 90%. \n\nThe end.\n\nMoral of the story. Man will always make you pay a price for your illusion of \"freedom\".",

        "body": "I saw you, in the back of the room, keeping your distance from me. You know who you are. You know who I am. Sitting back there with clammy hands. Staring at me from behind. Coming up in your head with all kinds of ways to approach me but your body won\u2019t do what your mind wants it to. Like they are two separate entities of you. You look around to see if anyone notices you daydreaming. That\u2019s what shy boys do to make up for what they lack in. They have big imaginations that don\u2019t get much attention.\n\nI get up to go to the bathroom. You follow me far behind, just to watch how I walk, how my hips move from one side to the other full of confidence and grace. Making you even more afraid to come near me. You aren\u2019t worthy of her. She could lure anyone she wants. You\u2019re staring down the hall, trying to come up with something to say or some way to bump into her just so you can feel her presence surround you. You wish you could hear her voice ask you what your name is. Would she reciprocate the same gut churning feelings you are having? Too many past rejections have made you scared to approach this lioness in your sights.\n\nCatching you by surprise, she peeks around the wall. She knows you are there, watching her. She stares at you with big dark eyes blushing in your direction. You try to act cool, trying to turn around and walk away like your some kind of marlboro man. But you just step on your own two feet. Making her smirk at you. You\u2019re embarrassed. But you smirk back at her.\n\nYou walk over back to where you were seated before. Minutes later she strolls in and takes a seat next to you. Looking at you while she carefully straightens her short pencil skirt. You can smell the faint scent of lavender emitting from her direction. You\u2019re fixated on her lips, thick and juicy begging for you to take a bite. But you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t even manage to smile, or say hi. Your a complete wreck. She turns to look at you, lightly smiling, like your pathetic in some way. Does she feel sorry for you? Sitting all alone in the corner of the room. She starts to stare at you, you notice her scanning you for all those parts on your body that make women go crazy. Eyes, lips, biceps, chest, hand size, height. She\u2019s calculating your length in her mind and you know it. You start to choke up, you can\u2019t breath. You cough and smile at her, just to break this awkward silence that\u2019s happening between the two of you.\n\nShe gets the message. She turns her head to the front of the room. You try and sneak a peak back with your peripheral vision, hoping she won\u2019t notice you. He hair is draped to one side, you can see her neck, hair laid back behind her ear. Small curls draping on her shoulder. She knows your looking, and she\u2019s allowing you to have a look. It\u2019s your turn to do the sniffing, to check out what the earth and sky made of her. Parts of her that you could be enjoying if only you could find the words to ask her to go out with you tonight. Take her somewhere nice and quite where you could be alone together. But just the thought of being alone together has you even more nervous.\n\nYou want to say something to her. Anything. Your lips start to quiver and she catches it. You quickly revert your eyes back to the front of the room. You turn white as a ghost. The blood underneath your skin starts rushing to places you hope no one will see. Especially her. She would be creeped out. You\u2019ve gotta get up and walk away before the unthinkable happens. As you start to adjust yourself to sit up, she grabs for you hand. Her small fingers trying to wrap themselves over your large hand. You freeze up instantly, allowing her to do what she pleases with you. You are so excited at the unexpected scene, the feel of her warm skin touching yours. Soft and gentle her hands are, she looks at you and places your hand in her lap. Places her other hand on top of both of yours. Holding you in place there. Your hand is at the top most peak of her skirt. Right above her womanhood. Is anyone else seeing this? Don\u2019t start to sweat now. You start chanting to yourself not to get an erection. She\u2019s starts rubbing her finger against your thumb in a slow motion. Back and forth so gently. It\u2019s driving you crazy. Your mind wants to get up and run, but your body wants to stay here with her. Allowing her to take advantage of your weakness for her simple touching. The jolt of electricity you feel running thru your body has your imagination going wild.\n\nOh the things you would do to her, for her, if the two of you were alone together.",

I had some up and downs of course as we all do, but eventually, I'm getting over it. \n\nMy question is regarding other people our age. Specifically ENFP's. I've noticed thru dating and watching my friends age along with me. That some of my friends have completely MATURED past the point that they just no longer have an optimistic view point of anything in the world. Everything irritates them. They are completely miserable about shit. They get easily agitated and nothing in the world ever seems to make them happy unless it's superficial I suppose. They could have great relationships and still feel unhappy and angry about something. \n\nIt's odd for me to date men like this and have best friends who have grown into this. When I don't feel the same. I still feel like a teenager inside, just a matured one. But I still am very optimistic about some things. I still have the capacity to love and welcome love. I still enjoy peoples company and stuff doesn't bother me much. I have great patience for kids and most things in life in general. It's so odd to me that someone else can have everything and still be so angry and yet, I have had a super hard life and somehow I can still put a smile on my face. \n\nI'm not say I'm always that way. But for the most part, I am. I enjoy the company of people who are happy like me. But then I feel like I need to rescue and help the miserable people. And I just want to see them happy because seeing someone miserable for no reason, is hard to look at. \n\nI can't seem to find too many people whom are just overall happy about life and not scared to love or be loved. :(\n\nWhat say you?",

        "body": "I'v made a mess of my romantic life. I've been single the last 5 years from an 11 year divorce. I'm finally in a place where I can actually accept a new man in my life instead of dwelling on going back home. I'm over my ex husband and know for certain we can never be back together. But just because I'm over someone, doesn't mean that I still don't miss the family aspect that came with being marred. And thats where you come in hopefully.\u00a0\n\nI've had 5 years to learn to be all alone. Not of my choice of course, but that's how things panned out. With my alone time I've accomplished some great things. I'm going to have a second educational degree which will propel me forward in life. I bought us a home in the outskirts of town. 3 Bedrooms and 2 baths. But of course, we don't HAVE to live here in this home. But I do want to stay in this area. So I'm hoping, that you are somewhere nearby already or on you way here.\u00a0\n\nI can cook some pretty good food. So if you like food, I'll be able to take care of you and make you happy. I can fix most things because I like to think I'm pretty damn smart and can learn fairly quickly just by watching a youtube video or following a tutorial. I love kids and animals. I love trees and lakes.\u00a0\n\nI'm also very excited for your arrival. I've been thru my depressed phases being single.It's kinda like grieving the dead ya know. So many phases you have to endure until some sort of peace is achieved with the circumstance. But now that i've accomplished some things I wanted, I feel much more proud of myself. So i'm much more happier and grateful about life. But also scared, because after 30, you start seeing everyone around you dying. It's terrifying really. And everyone just keeps going on with life like you were never there. So, it would be nice to share some life with you, before either one of us expires.\u00a0\n\nI've realized what's most important in life and that's you and my kids. The missing equation is you. Once we lay eyes on each other, there won't be a moment that I'm unhappy around you. I'm hoping you feel the same. All I want to do is make you happy every day and take you on adventures. Take you in my truck and watch the stars at night from anywhere we want to park and smoke a bowl. I'd like to go fishing and I'd like to so swimming ALOT in the lakes. I love jumping off the bridges and off the rocks into the water.  \nI want you to meet all my friends. I just want us both to be happy and watching movies and playing video games and taking the kids for drives out to nowhere and back again. I want to see the world with you. I want to take you to all the different restaurants and I want to kiss you goodnight. I want to show you places you've never seen and I want you to do the same for me. I hope you're a romantic, because I very much am. A super sappy one too. Pretty creative and thoughtful if I might\u00a0brag a bit about myself.\u00a0\n\nAlso, I do have a huge ego. I'm probably one of the most humble people with a huge ego you might have ever met. A little arrogant around the edges and the most insecure, high self esteem person you'll ever meet too. I like myself. I think you'll like me too. Anyone who doesn't like me can kiss my fuckin ass. Cause I know what I'm about. I aint on that miserable ass shit from day to day like some people be on. I'm a kid at heart. I'm a playful teenager. I'm very sensual and sexual and will want to be intimate on a super regular basis. I'm mature when I have to be, like paying stupid fuckin bills and shit. and getting homework done last minute and all that bullshit too.\u00a0\n\nI don't normally feel awkward or anxious. I don't give a fuck what people think about me, which is good and sometimes bad. I'm super blunt and honest which can throw people off sometimes. I'm not sensitive to much. I make super inappropriate jokes that I can only tell a select few. So if you haven't heard one, we ain't that close! I feel like I'm pretty easy to get along with, as long as you are. I'm loyal and faithful as long as you are. lol. Just don't get on my bad side and we are both cool.\u00a0\n\nI'd like to spend our mornings exercising together. We could do yoga, or run or jump rope. Whatever, as long as it's with you, I don't care what we do. I'm into almost anything as long as I'm sharing it with someone I care about. I hope you like to dance to music all hours of the night, cause when the kids are gone, I fuckin LOVE that shit. I'll dance till 2 in the morning for hours and hours getting drunk off rum and wine. I like to turn my living room into a club. But I'm at home, so it's way cooler cause I can get as fucked up as I want and not worry about getting in fights with anyone. Well, maybe my shadows ;)\n\nI'm a pretty happy person, so I hope you are too. I don't get agitated by much, especially\u00a0when you will be by\u00a0my side. I'm encouraged to stay bright with the light of you in my life. I hope you have already learned patience, because I'm fairly patient with kids. Maybe not clients so much, but kids definitely! Spilled milked, broken things, and dirty clothes don't bother me at all. It's all none-sense and can be replaced.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, I'm not to bad looking either. So get here quick before I get too old!",

        "body": "Have always been a career driven woman who finds wisdom in the variety of life. I immerse myself into casual reading and love learning. Smart is the real definition of sexy. \n\nI laugh at everything...seriously. I will appreciate your carefree attitude and awful jokes crack me up.... I would also settle for being the person who can make you laugh. I'm a sarcastic human being. Friends would describe me as: quirky, sweet and sometimes crazy. Slightly dented, but light on the inside. \n\nI speak my mind and am very mindful of other people's feelings. I've acquired the wit that goes with being alive in the world. I prefer the abnormal and intense. \n\nI am not a designer brand lady, I enjoy the humble beginnings of stories and adore the country life.  I've been listening to country music lately. Could you be close by? Is that you? NO? It's cool. I love ALL music. From Beethoven to Arvo Parte, from Creedance Clearwater Revival to Pink Floyd. From Token to Juicy J. \n\nDo you write music? My sister is a musical genius. I have a soft spot for musical composers. \n\nI have a beautiful artistic side that craves to create with you. I have a business side that is constantly inventing ways to pay off my house with a trinket and a high profit margin during a busy holiday season. \n\nI enjoy writing, reading, and poetry. Your handwritten poems about the universe you saw in that underwater aquarium on Neptune in the summer solstice will soothe my heart. Kind of a nerdy girl at heart that enjoys board games, Xbox and NES games. \n\nI love to dance. Maybe we can take a class sometime?  I don't really care about today's weather or who's in the white house.... Tell me how the stars were made or how the west was won. Tell me of your own philosophies or dreams and my face will light up.\n\nAre you someone who thinks that learning is a lifetime effort? Are you Involved in constant self improvement and career driven? Will you be my mentor in my life...because your life experience is fascinating to me. \n\nAre you are fun, sarcastic and beautifully tormented? Teach me about what you learned in your life whilst standing on the edge of the world. \n\nI know we will have a strong physical connection and desire. My body is your playground. And we can be found at recess twice a day 5 days a week! You are an expert at making my knees weak.\n\nI imagine you are confident and a responsible type of man who also explores the universe in his mind. \n\nI imagine you are good with children and have the patience to deal with family life. Quality time is one of your core love languages.\n\nYou are committed to our connection. You are seeking me, as I am seeking you. \n\nI want to walk hand in hand with your strong intellectual mind and articulate tongue that shines silver like a beast. \n\nOr maybe you are more of a man of few words? That's okay. Shy boys have a special place in my heart. I can have fun in the silence of your company just as much as I would anyone else. \n\nAs long as you are there with me, hand in hand, till our end. Friends till the end. \n\nMy destiny is you. \n\nIt always has been. \n\nFind me.",

I've become determined to manifest you into my world. \n\nI just wonder, how perfect or imperfect you might be. \n\nI've met a lot of different men over the last years of my single life. In turn, learning more about myself and what I enjoy having in my life and what I should never accept. \n\nIf a man doesn't want to spend significant time with you, he's not made for your future. A man who wants a future spent next to me, won't mind spending the time. Because ultimately, that time will turn into everyday as we morph into living with one another, and maybe one day, we marry. \n\nIf a man doesn't make you feel like the most beautiful woman in the world, he's garbage and not for me. I know now what it feels like to be loved with such an intensity, devotion and loyalty. That's exactly what I'll seek. Because it's exactly what I give. \n\nI like men who know exactly what they want and aren't vague. Men with purpose who seek and create their dreams. Too often is the man who who wants to venture down the road of 'friendship' with no clear vision of what he actually wants. Wasting so much of my time. I have learned to throw people like that out of my radar. \n\nI won't be with anyone that thinks I'm stupid or makes me feel mentally inferior in someway. I can't understand how I can feel so highly about myself and have a partner that wouldn't reflect that. A partner is suppose to be a mirror. He's suppose to show you what you are and what potential you can be. He's not suppose to bring you down and try to destroy the image of yourself. \n\nI like inventing things and making businesses. I would really love, if that was something we did together. \n\nI talk on the phone, you do too. \n\nI can't stand hearing men tell me. *I wanted to go to school. I want to go to school one day. I wanted to start a business, I want to start a business one day. I would love to have a home on acreage, one day.* No, you do. Or you don't. I can't stand listening to dreams. You either make them reality or your not doing anything but talking nonsense. I'm at a age where I'm way to old to hear these middle aged men talking about dreams they should have already attained or at least should be working on attaining. \n\nDreams are for kids. Kids, who have power to make their dreams come true. \n\nSo, instead of engaging 3 - 5 men a year on dates. I'll do my best to engage much more men so that I can find you, finally. I blame myself for not putting the effort I should have. For letting people waste my time, when I should have just let them go and continue searching.\n\nHopefully, it was all worth it to find the man (or woman?) I should have been looking for. You. :D",

I always wondered why everyone felt it was necessary to project their own wants and needs onto other people as a whole. As if their way is the ONLY way a person can truly be happy. I mean, what is it to you that your neighbor or friend live their lives in some way that has absolutely nothing to do with your own life?\n\nWhy can't people just worry about themselves?\n\nI have put some thought into weather I could do a polyamory type relationship. I still don't know. But the further I think about it, the more I think not. And it's because there is some logical thinking I put into it that pertains to my own personality.\n\n1. I idolize my mate. I can't idolize 2 people at once. It's just not possible for me. Maybe it's the romantic poet in me. I'm not sure, but I tend to love being obsessed with my partner and hold them high on a pedestal. They are my bible. My god. My sun. My world. My pride for them is reflected in smile, my writings, and my attitude. When you are a hero or a king, there is only one of you. \n2. I think just like with anything in life, anytime you become an expert at something, it's usually because you put your heart and soul into it. It's the one subject matter you chose to focus on. The moment I try to divulge in more than one person, I've spread myself too thin. A jack of all trades is an expert in nothing. When you spread yourself thin, it can be overwhelming as well. You don't give your all to someone/something. Which isn't good for you, nor them.\n\nI prefer the ME and YOU against the world kinda love.\n\nYou thirst upon my blood and I feast upon yours.",

I had forgot what I look like. It had been so long since I actually cared. Sure the mirror is always there when I go pee or brush my teeth. But I avoid me.

I'm having such bad luck trying to find the one meant to share life with me, I figured I better try harder. And since I'm a fool for an articulate man, I know one day I might possibly find him thru his words spilled upon the screen. As I am a writer, so too shall he be. I'm in my later 30's. On the west coast of the USA. \n\nI have long black curly hair and tan skin for I'm a hispanic and caucasian person. I have my life together. 2 Degrees and fairly well established in life. I have a lot to offer someone good hearted and looking for love.\n\nI'm a very sex positive person and it's one of my love languages. However, I also don't feel that I'm a very uninhibited person. My sexuality runs as far as the coast on the beaches of my lover. \n\nBut I do enjoy uninhibited people, so feel free to bear yourself as you want and find the person looking for you. \n\nI'm not that bad looking. So if you feel like connecting with me and we vibe, I'd love to share pictures with each other. I'm more of a phone talker, so if that's not something you're comfortable with, don't bother. \n\nI plan to find someone to have a meaningful relationship with who'll be comfortable enough to eventually move into my home with me if things became serious.",

        "title": "When I Am In Love",
        "body": "When I am in love, the world is nothing but a playground. I could go anywhere with my lover and feel entertained by the smallest events. Simply, because they are done, with him.\n\nA simple walk in the woods, among the skinny and fat green trees that sway with the melodic wind. Leaves dancing to the tune of our frequencies hitting high notes among the clouds. He\u2019d pack me a lunch and take me on an adventure, where my shoes begin to tip and tap along the rocky trail as we walk the path. Until we reach his secret destination. A picnic in which he\u2019s cleverly brought all my most favorite of treats. The simplicity of a rustic bread with a crunchy crust. Savory fancy oils and vinegars. A sampler of mediterranean marinated feta cheeses and greek olives. A bottle of red wine. A blunt to savor the enhanced flavors of his love, dripping from my glistening lips as I indulge myself in the feast he prepared just for me.\n\nWhy is he such an angel? Why did god send him to me? How could I be so lucky? The rhythmic movement of his fingers as he places each of my treats before me is like watching a pianist write a masterpiece. His concentration on where he places each thing before me is calculated and precise. He has decided how much I should eat and what I should eat. I take comfort in the contemplative care of his simple acts.\n\nThe simple display of him cutting into an apple draws astonishment from me. For this apple represents life, that he feeds unto me. I want to crawl under his skin and become him. I want his soul to undress me and overtake me until I\u2019m a walking talking feminine version of him. I want the world to see the creation he is molding of me. I want him to forge the greatest version of me with his chisel and hammer. Chipping away the useless parts and replacing them with stronger ones.\n\nLifting my legs up high so that I can reach my tip toes to the sky, pointed toward god and laugh. He will stretch me like taffy and unbind me and wind me and unbind me again. Throw me against the table and fold me up till I\u2019m 10,000 layers of complexity all perfectly aligned and organized. So he can go thru each page and memorize, me. For I am his book and he is my reader. A reader, who has become a narrator as we write together on the empty pages that lie ahead.\n\nHe navigates my emotional and sensual conditions by following\u00a0 the compass of my heart. He is a riddle box romantic, whose duty is to find my smile behind my shadows with the whip of his silver tongue.\n\nWhen I am in love, my duty is to lift him high and remind him of strengths. To relinquish control for he can be trusted to guide us unto the right paths. He is humble, confident, responsible, immaturely mature, ambitious, sexy, and goofy. He\u2019s not afraid to show his childlike side. And he\u2019s definitely not afraid of me.\n\nDeep down, I\u2019m just a soft and timid person. He is a volcano, mighty and powerful. Made of stone and fire, he builds me a little cave inside the edges of himself so that I might hideaway inside him. I\u2019ve had to be hard my whole life. He keeps me soft underneath the warmth and safety of his rageful core. He is the person whom I can let take the wheel and lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from the evil. He gives me wings. So that I might fly around his tree trunk, sternly rooted. He is the fury, so that I don\u2019t have to be. Nevermore.\n\nThe light of his eyes pull me in like angler fish luring his prey and he will swallow me whole. I will become him. We will be one. It is there, my heart will swell, like the peach that james was told not to eat. Oh but when he did, that poor orphan boy found a uncharted world of animated wonder. A fantastical adventure breaking from the branches and\u00a0 falling down like jack &amp; jill from atop blueberry hill. To reach the edge of the ocean and be swallowed by its vast unknown. Alone, in fear.\n\nAh my heart, always lost on a story that I paint you in. A memory of a man who isn\u2019t mine. A salvadore dali thats lost in time. I\u2019m going out of my mind trying to find him. These breadcrumbs aren\u2019t enough. I want him. I am starved without him. An empty belly. An unmotivated mind. An infatuated fan with too much time. And no real reason or rhyme. For anything I do.\n\nWhen I am in love, the world is celestial paradise. He is my god and I have reached the almighty nirvana. For I see myself in him. And in that, I have become god.\n\nAnd if I do not love you? The world is grey and grim.\n\nBecause my mind is lived, in the shadow of him.",
