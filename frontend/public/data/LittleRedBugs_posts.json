The Socrates approach is a sure fire way to be ostracized from your closest circles even unto the community.\n\n\nIt makes me wonder if the best policy is to question when questioned and answer when asked for an answer, but at the same time, it makes me cautious to enter a conversation or discussion with people who immediatly 'vibe' as emotionally opinionated and ardent on their position. \n\nI'm coming to find it's not even worth the time, and Philosophy has only opened my eyes to the ignorance that rests among the public.\n\n\nThoughts, Comments, Questions, Concerns?

        "body": "This girl interjected herself into a conversation I was participating in with a few other girls at the bar. The topic of college majors came about, and one girl was going for a degree in 'military psychology'.\n\nSo, nonsensical me, yep this guy, makes a slight joke that flies way over her head. I said, \"So, what's so intricate about that? You sign up for war. You sign up to kill people, and you can either handle it or can't\".\n\nTo which the two girl in the conversation said, \"Wow, you're so ignorant that's such an ignorant question\".\n\nLOL, Okay, so yeah, I deserved it right, but I was making a joke and a point, and of course, I couldn't stop there, right(probably should have)?\n\nSo, I question, \"In what way is that ignorant? People know what they are getting into before they sign up for the military, if they don't, that's ignorance on their part\".\n\n\nAt this point, the angry girl(drunk), interjects into the conversation(in defense of the other girls who couldn't respond as to their own statements), and she starts going off on things such as:\n\n1. Statistics of suicide\n2. Statistics of casualties\n3. Fellow soldiers dying in your arms\n4. Killing someone(asked if I could kill someone)\n5. Her Brother had PTSD from being a veteran.\n\nAll the while, I keep expressing my ignorance(of course), insisting that people that sign up for war, sign up for war, but my points didn't hold much with them.\n\nSo, after five minutes of battering back their emotional outlast(which came from one joke) and attempting to understand her degree, the bar tender on staff(chill dude) became my lifeline and shut the convo down.\n\nLater overhead the angry girl continuing to rant about the conversation to a guy she was dating, oblivious that I could hear her.\n\nIt's funny, I was close to telling her: -I know more about PTSD than you could possibly imagine, I have Manic Depressive Disorder, and unlike the military, I didn't have a choice, I had no way of knowing what it would be like. - But, I just let it go, I wouldn't let these type of people affect me or my mood, and continued to have a good night.\n\nIt was interesting. Learned a bar isn't the best place to interact with strangers, especially when they fire the emotion cannon. \n\n\nI guess at the end of the day, I was ignorant, in that I didn't think about the crowd before I pitched the joke.\n\n\nAnyways, semi-rant over, and I know there are Vets that trigger into Bipolar, and by no means, take my words as derogatory.\n\n\nHas anyone else had an experience similar, wherein, someone blatantly disregards you as ignorant? How do resist the temptation to indulge them? It's very difficult for me, I seem to have a 'socrates' complex when it comes to coversation.\n\n\nAnyways,\n\nBest Regards,\nLittleRedBugs",

A professor dropped my grade an entire letter, but the light shines brighter on my success and their failure. It's more disappointing that they let me down, but I can laugh and smile at knowing that I earned a higher grade. I can view the entire course, seeing routinely high scores throughout that semester. I can see the one grade that knocked me a letter down. I can laugh at the 0 I receive for a grade, and how comical that professor looks. I can laugh over the professor grading my work two months after the fact and updating the grade seven days before the final. I can see the A on the final project and the A on the final exam, and know that I gave it my all, and the professor's consideration and respect for me was not as high as my respect for them.

        "body": "Discussing your mental health plan is a serious conversation to have with your Pdoc. Your personal progression through life with a full medication schedule or a sparse schedule is your responsibility. I'll tell you my story. I took on the world. I kept taking on responsibilities until I collapsed. I was a musician, organization leader, office worker, full time student, boyfriend, and a low scale cannabis broker(bulk buyer for my own habits and a select group of friends). In one week, I played the biggest show of my life, lost my job, un-earthed a coo against me in my organization, had finals week(failed out), broke up with my girlfriend,nearly had my residence raided. Talk about a stressful week. I had a mental breakdown, months in the brewing. Through a combination of this stress, a lack of sleep, and my migraine medication, my hypomania peaked and I experienced psychosis for the first time. I was coming down from the experience, when I went to the emergency room(anticipating a blood test for a case of mono (my girlfriend had also been sick, never confirmed mono though). My Dad deceived me, and within a matter on minutes I had pissed in a cup and was tranquilized against my will. In the meantime, my Dad was coerced into agreeing for me to be transported to a psyche hospital. I awoke in the ER and two police offices entered, and I was cuffed and place in the back of a squad car and driven off to the psychiatric hospital where I was coerced into voluntarily admitting myself. I had a nights sleep and was evaluated in the morning by my Pdoc. In his initial reports, he and his staff expected me to stay a few days at the most. It was not until I was subjected to anti-psyches that I triggered into a psychosis once more. My stay extended to two and half weeks. Eventually, my parents wised the fuck up, and realized how terrible the administration executed their hospital. A nurse literally doped me up on an antipsych, waited for it to kick in, and coerced me to sign that I did not want to discharge(voluntary admitted can legally discharge at will). It wasn't until my parents threatened a lawsuit that I was able to discharge and for about two weeks I suffered extreme withdrawals from the medications they administered to me. I struggled with my Pdoc for about a month on systematically decreasing my antipsych and demanded a minimal level on a mood stabilizer. Within three months, I quit my mood stabilizer cold turkey and continued unmediated for five or six months before my parents found out and began monitoring my medication, and the rest is a tale for another time.\n\n\n\n For the past six months, I have been extracting the medication and pretending to take it to appease my parents. My Pdoc and I had a conversation six months ago, and we agreed to ween off the mood stabilizer. My Pdoc canceled our last appointment for personal reasons, and then released me from his care after his hospital duties become more rigorous. My Pdoc's practice took on a new Doc, and I have planned to meet and switch my care over to them. My Pdoc would never have agreed to withdrawing the medication unless he had tracked my progress and ability riding the edge on medication levels. My Pdoc understood and recognized that my parent's perception of my progress was not the most valid indicator of how I was progressing; in fact, we broke my sessions up in half. The first half I would actually meet and discuss the truth with my Pdoc, and then my parents would come in and have their say; all the time, my Pdoc expressing that he and I both knew why I continued to see him, mainly to appease my parents and keep their stress on my life to a minimum. Now, don't get me wrong, I love my parents and they love me, but they are quite ignorant when it comes to genetic disorders and don't know what to do but \"hawk\" over every aspect of my life. I gave them the nickname \"the wardens\" for controlling and monitoring my medicine. LOL I had to change my life to take back control of my life, and coming off medication was not a solution. It was not the first step, but it was a step that I planned with my Pdoc and with his confidence. \n\n\n\nAm I an anti-medication nut? Truthfully yes, but I am not naive. I keep my prescriptions up to date. I have my safety net prepared. I recognize that the medication had a vital role in my recovery, and it is vital for most Bpers to maintain their medication schedules with their Pdoc's confidence. I hope my story relates and that you don't take your predicament lightly. Demand the best out of your Pdoc; set the bar high. A strong Pdoc was my best medicine.",

Anytime she steps out of line, I can easily coax her back just by giving the slightest attention to another woman.\n\nIt's good and bad, but I mean, she's very loyal to me, and we've been together near 2 years, I have her V card, we make love 3-8 times per week, I take her out on 4-5 dates per week, hold respect with her father(she's Hispanic...big macho quality to be cool with Dad), and I work 14-18 hours, six days a week, so basically, in my free time I am just on a pillar. My Sexual value whatever is infinite, I literally have no trouble with women, only power tripping bitches. \n\nI guess unfortunatly, I have the body, brains, work ethic of an Alpha, but I have the heart of the beta.\n\nCan I pull off the white night, or am I just hurting the cause, fellahs?\n\nThanks,\nLittleRedBugs\n\nEDIT: Only a DISDAIN for women out of line and out of place, fake ass bitches.",

        "body": "I'm 240lbs, 23% body fat. I used to do Olympic lifting training. My mass is still impressive, I've just not taken the time to go to the gym. At this point, do I even fucking have to, other than to improve myself? I tore my achilles injury 2 years ago, literally a week or two after beginning my LTR. I used to be a more toned and around 15% body fat.\n\nAfter months of gradual convincing, I convinced my LTR to get a membership at my gym, and we have started going together from time to time.\n\nCurrently, I have other goals than my \"health\" persay, but I eat a hearty diet(healthy food, not junk). My BMI is atrocious because of my muscle density; however, I am slightly overweight, I think I'd like to get back down to 15-18%, which I know I am capable of doing in 2-3 weeks of twice-a-day routines.\n\nIs it worth pulling off my work schedule(I work 14-18 hours, 6 days a week) in order to improve my health for the sake of my SMV, or would the loss of income and work detract from my SMV.\n\nI suppose the question is: Do I need to balance my tactics in my LTR? I am happy, she is happy, and we are slowly improving our health, but we aren't overly concerned with being god-like models.\n\n;TLDR I'm overweight, but my overall SMV is good. My LTR doesn't seem to have a problem whatsoever with my weight; she is satisfied by my weight(As well as our sexual relationship), and I see this LTR as going the distance. Do I need to change my physical appearance, am I just waiting to get shot in the foot later down the road?\n\nThanks,\nLittleRedBugs",

Since the 5th grade, I would stay up till 1-2am and rise by 6 to go to school. Somtimes, I'd go to bed as early as 9 or 10 in order to wake up a 3 or 4 in the morning to play this game.\n\n\nWas this not a major indicator? Could they not see the mischievousness and vindictiveness of my actions?\n\n\nI would ascertain their email passwords, computer passwords. I would learn new ways to hide my game play. Some days, I would play 18-30 hours, spilling over into tomorrows dreamland.\n\n\nThis game shaped me, molded me, taught me many things about life. It was truely a useful tool, and probably post-poned my eventually rendevue with fate, the fate of hospitalization in my twenties.\n\n\nYet, I can't help but think: Why did they not see IT?\n\nLooking back, I see it now. How could I, as a child, comprehend what I was doing to my mind and to my body. For all I knew, I was a kid, a kid addicted to video games and staying up all night long. I was a go-getter. I was an athelete. I was a straight A student. I saw what I wanted, and I gave it everything I had.\n\n\nI guess I never failed in life, until my twenties. Perhaps, I didn't fail enough, and this curse, this plague, these genetics, were a reminder that we are all fallable. That we all fall. That no one is free from repercussions. We all must stand the tests of life.\n\n\nI just wish I had been more prepared and aware of the challenges I would face.\n\nTLDR; Bipolar man, If I could go back, I'd see the signs, the obvious signs.",

        "body": "TLDR; Get back to the basics of well-being, and prioritize a healthy lifestyle, in the body, in the home, in the wallet, in the career, in the mind.\n\nIs it a good thing to clean my closet? Why bother, my life's a mess, it doesn't matter. Should I brush my hair? Should I vacuum my carpet. Why? I've been lying around all day. I've been loathing. Why do such minuscule tasks? I have SO MUCH to worry about, so much to do, so many things unfinished. Why on earth would I waste time doing something so small. \n\n\nThis message may be better received by the depressed, but possible the manic who feel overwhelmed:\n\n\nGive your self no room to be complacent. Start in your dwelling. It's about accomplishing small tasks, not only for the sake of repetition, focus, and habit building, but because once you knock out the small things, then you get BETTER and FASTER at doing them, this will give you more time to focus on 'the big picture'.\n\nHere's the short list: 1. Attend to your room\n\n 2. Attend to your bathroom\n\n 3. Attend to your living areas\n\n 4. Attend to your kitchen\n\nBed made, one load of laundry per week, change your sheets once a week, keep your closet tidy, vacuum once per week, dust once per week.\n\nClean your tub once per month, clean the sink once per week, clean the mirror once per week, the floor, etc.\n\nYou get the picture? Now your living spaces, now your kitchen area.\n\nAttend to your dwelling so that you may be free form the burden of it. Do not let complacency keep your mind from 'the big picture' because you've got to 'do the chores'. Go ahead and knock out the small stuff just so you can have a clear space, a place to think, a place to relax.\n\nCleaning your dwelling and belongings is the first step.\n\nWhy? Does a dirty mole live in a dirty hole? Yes, yes it does. If you clean your dwelling, you will notice that you need to take the next step, cleaning you.\n\nProper hygiene:\n\nbrush teeth, combo hair, shower daily, wash hair a few times a week, floss, perfume/cologne/deodorant, dress sharply, dress for success, dress your best, clip your nails, present yourself in the most refreshing, cleanest way. Feel good about taking care of your personal hygiene. You don't have to go overboard, and eventually it becomes mere minutes of your daily routine. It's sometimes fun to 'race the clock' and see just how fast you can get through it all.\n\nSo the next step, you've got a clean dwelling, you've got a clean and kept up body, so are you going to eat junk food all day and have an IV of coca cola? Hell no. You've got a clean space, a clean body, it's time to focus on a clean diet. Try to incorporate foods high in micro-nutrients into your diet, get on a regular eating schedule, plan healthy snacks. Get on a general routine of eating. Even if you don't want to, you really do. Eat TASTY healthy food. I've felt the 'im bipolar, I'm not hungry' many times, but after a few tastes of GOOD tasting, healthy food, my appetite spikes. If you get in a good routine, your appetite will naturally spike around certain times of the day. Some people barely eat breakfast, but after getting into the habit, they eventually wake up hungry for a huge breakfast, it's all about pushing into a system, a logical progression of steps to improve your well-being.\n\nSo, clean dwelling, clean body, clean diet. What else can we clean at this point? From here, it really depends on the plan you set, but I think that it's most important to solidify what you can do easily versus taking on some of the 'harder to break' \"symptoms\" of bipolar.\n\nMy next recommendation is to clean your finances. You've got debt? Sit down with a financial planner. There are some free resources for this, and no you don't act on their advice, but it will be a great source of learning. You've got to set a budget, for your own personal peace of mind. You need to know how much \"money\" or rather time spent working, do I require to maintain and keep myself healthy. Don't think about kids, a family, entertainment. Netflix is $8 bucks a month(do that), you can chill on the entertainment for right now, you gotta get down to the basics. Once you get to the basics, find a job that will cover your basics, and if you are in debt, you need to find a job that covers the basics, but also helps you take down the debt. ---&gt; I am a financial planner as well, and there are many steps to take, but the first two steps of establishing income, saving money( PAY yourself), and get rid of debts. I can go further if you would like to know more, but I promise you that having a strong financial sense will help control your thoughts and behaviors, and keep you away from financial traps and spending sprees.\n\nSo, clean dwelling, clean body, clean diet, clean finances, CLEAN JOB. I'd like to further expound upon this. I think you should go for the best job your education can offer you, but you've got to way the pros and cons. Really consider employee benefits, really consider drive time as a major LOSS of time. If you have to drive a total of an hour or more for work, factor that out of your pay and your life as loss of time. You didn't work 8 hours that day, you worked 10, considering the lunch and the drive time. You want to compensate by finding a job closer to home, that is the most congruent chunk of time. Pick a job that you know has a great training program. BRING THIS UP IN INTERVIEWS. \"Tell me about your employee training\". This is almost the most important question you can EVER ask in an interview IF you want to keep your stress levels low, and find a job that is not stressful. Jobs are only stressful when you don't know what to do exactly. Finding the right job, a 'clean' job, will truly benefit your overall well-being.\n\nClean dwelling, clean body, clean diet, clean finances, clean job. You're making your way up Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs pyramid. I know I've talked about a lot, and honestly, this would take at least 30-60 days to accomplish and get a good foot hold on, so I'll stop here. Feel free to follow up for the next steps, which include clean friendships, clean relationships, clean life.\n\nIf you start small on this steps, and progress back through what's really important in your life, well-being, and survival. You'll come to find that you won't have time to consider 100s of different impulses at once. You'll have your mind so busy on your own well-being, that the rest will just fall into place.\n\nMake your wellness, your well-being, your lifestyle, the path forward. Set this as your goal, your dream, your priority. Get back on top of just being you and taking care of your needs on the basic level. The path forward is straight and narrow. You've got to make your way back on to the path.",

I don't know, this heightened awareness is really fucking with my ability to just focus on my priority, which is maintaining a balanced lifestyle(I don't routinely take meds). I've been trying to get an appointment with my Pdoc, but her assistant is a POS and can't pick up the damn phone when I call, and I've called at different times during the day.

        "title": "Insight, intuition, and Medication",
        "body": "Good evening Reddit BPers,\n\nSo, I was meditating the other day, and I got to thinking about insight. We lose insight when manic or when in major depression, but the question is this: What does it mean to lose insight?\n\nI've come to the conclusion that this is our insight, our own person or personality. How did I come to this conclusion? Well recently, I've tried a new drug cocktail, and I've noticed all the nasty, negative side effects, side effects which led me to live medication free before. \n\nSo, how did I get back to this point of needing medication? Well, through many major life events, I put myself back into stressful situations which exacerbated my general well-being. Sound familiar?\n\nWell, let's get back to insight. So, while meditating, I began to really dig deep into this insight my Pdoc supposed I had lost. Come to think of it, my insight and intuition increased in manic states and decreased in depressed states. This makes sense, but on the far end of mania, this insight, this intuition, can be a very powerful drug. On the other end of depression, this willfulness to deny insight or intuition, can also lead to a very dark places.\n\nSo, is the answer balance? No, not really. Balance so I thought, would mean equal parts insight/intuition when manic and depressed, but I found that mood stabilizers did no such thing, they simply redirected insight and intuition to oneself. In a sense, giving oneself permission to be completely selfish, solely focused on one's own life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why am I here tonight, why am I posting when I've been away from the subreddit for quite some time. I have woken back up, through reducing stressors and taking Rx Stimulants and AntiPsychs, I've become intuitive again. Not that I lost my insight, but in a sense, I was in a defensive position, and now I'm in an offensive state. I was quite aware in my depression, and avoided my problems. I was quite aware in my mania, I was pushing my limits. But is that not life?\n\nLately, I've noticed other people's pass-aggressive behavior, peoples insults and doublespeak. I feel like my mind has regenerated as to when I was younger. I am sharper. Focused. Determined. I feel as though I've over come the illness again. I'm back in the driver's seat. I am normal again. I've recently become debt free, been eating clean, working out every day, and maintaining a good routine. I was able to do this with the help of Rx Stimulants, but even those have become too powerful to stay on long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Trigger Warning: Obesity and Medication free life\\*\n\nNow that I have clarity of thought, insight, and intuition, I've decided to back off the drugs. I know, I know: isn't that a bad idea? I've lived medication free for years at a time, and lately I got motivated to get back in athletic shape. I was making significant progress, dieting and losing weight. I lost about 15lbs in a month or so. Everything has been going great! Until I started gaining weight. I felt the hypomania slipping away. The  Rx stimulant has done its job, pulling me out of a major depressive episode(fueled by alcoholism). I thought this was great, and had asked the Pdoc to increase the dosage. I started to anticipate other's actions, speech, ideas. My mind was racing, and I was gleaming insight from everything around me.  I tried to stay positive, I really did, but the mania was too much, and I could feel things getting out of hand. I lost MY insight. About ME. That's the insight I lost. I lost sight of what I(ME) wanted. MY goals. MY vision. \n\nJust as quickly as I had elevated myself, I could not feel pressure from everyone around me. Needless to say, I began taking mood stabilizers and antiPsycotics. Anytime I felt negativity from others, or felt them trying to influence me in a way I did not want, I would take my meds. This dependence on medication, is just as dangerous. I went from being in charge, being aggressive and determined, to being stagnant and not making decisions. I had reached balance, but there was no more progress. In a sense, I became stuck. I started to experience all the bad symptoms of these drugs, and most notably, after a few weeks on the drugs, I noticed that I had regained 10lbs. All my hard work, diminished just so I could play it safe and be balanced. Hey, if that's your bag of tea, by all means. I can't live life like this; refusing to use my insight, intuition for the greater good.\n\nSo, I'll be back tracking off the antiPsycs, then reduce the mood stabilizers, and finally reduce the stimulants, in a controlled manner. It's time to implement my support groups, and focus on improving my general well-being, one day at a time.\n\nI'm very fortunate and grateful of where I am in life, living with BP in the way I do. \n\nIf this relates to you, feel free to leave a comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always,\n\nLittleRedBugs",

How can people sustain themselves during this time without financial assistance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happens when medication shortages arise? What happens when the mentally ill can not get access to their medications? What happens when routine doctor's visits are put on hiatus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are troubling times, and certainly we must not fear the unknown, but we must prepare. There must be a way forward for the mentally ill. How can we shape a future where we can be assured that one of the most vulnerable populations of our society will not live in fear?  \n\n\nPlease feel free to openly discuss these questions and more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegards,\n\nLittle Red Bugs",

        "body": "I need help. I can't take it anymore. My wife is driving me up a wall. The entire house is on lock-down. \n\nI've got screaming kids running around while I have to work. She's gone on a bender, spending money left and right on binges and impulses. She's oversleeping, staying up late, complaining about the messiness of the house. Streaming Netflix all day, painting all day, playing video games all day. She just won't leave me alone. And the kids. Where do I even start? Tio this, Tio that. Knocking on my office door. Oops, we broke the Nintendo Switch. We are hungry. We need more activities. The kids want to see their Tio. Why are you working so much? Crying Toddler climbing the stairs by himself. Children throwing balls in the house. My wife is just enthralled, and treating the lock-down like some kind of super fantastic sleep over, FROM HELL.\n\nShe is so hypomanic, it's just too much right now. I can't even get out of the house to breath. Can't see my family, friends. Can't even just go drive around or go to the park.\n\nShe's paranoid, euphoric half the time, and the other half depressed and agitated. Like a bad mixed episode.\n\nThis quarantine has destroyed her routines. Her work sent her home for weeks. She wants to spend every minute of the day with me. Her sex drive is off the walls. I can't keep up with her anymore.\n\nI just don't even know where to begin. I'm an essential worker, and I have to work from home right now. My wife is driving me NUTS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-End Rant",

        "body": "A thought had crossed my mind. I've seen so many people reading Bipolar books, and it got me thinking about a key component of some of this literature, namely building a team of people to support you.\n\nI'd like to share why I do not have a team, nor support, and why I prefer being alone, except for appointments with the Pdoc.\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet.\n\n1. The less people that know you are Bipolar, the better your life will be.\n2. The less people that have a say about your Bipolar, the more say you have.\n3. The less people watching you, the less paranoia you have.\n4. The less people investigating your moods, the more stable you tend to be.\n5. The less people you're in relationship with, the less lies and deceit.\n\nI've found that the less interaction, the less I have to think about or know about a person, their relationship with other people, and it's a lot easier to spot narcs and people checking on you. You notice the abnormal a lot easier because you've separated yourself from everything and everyone.\n\nYou can better see people influencing you. You can see people taking advantage of you. You can see people being indirect to you. You can easily walk away with no attachment. \n\nWell, how then do you trust people, you might ask? Simple, I trust until I have reason to not trust, and in general, I only trust people who are direct, honest, and impartial. The greater the relationship with someone, the greater the influence.\n\nSounds harsh right? How do you have any meaningful relationships? Well, that's the key. I only have meaningful relationships now. This keeps me more stable than any medicine or therapy ever could.\n\nSocial distancing is driving people nuts, because people are so invested in other people, they haven't invested enough in themselves.\n\n\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It's our light not our darkness that most frightens us.\"\n\nRegards,\n\nLittleRedBugs",

        "body": "Any advice helps.\n\nNeed some insight and guidance. I've got about 3-4 years experience in CS, but if I put pen to paper, my professional work makes me look like a junior/novice developer and or a legacy junkie.\n\nMost recently, I wrote about 10k lines of code for production in about 3 weeks or so. If I could just have the 'keys to the kingdom', I could easily write 100k per year. I do not get enough high level projects or even medium level projects to warrant a raise/promotion. This year was supposed to be the big raise/promotion year, but COVID has fucked that up. Our employee reviews have been pushed out to August. I'm not sure I can keep holding on for false promises. Last year I was passed up b/c 'other Devs have been waiting longer than me, but you are doing a great job'.\n\nI'm too far into this to still be at a low level, and I've been taking out my retribution on my personal projects. I spend most of my days googling $$$ jobs and trying to implement their stacks/languages/frameworks on my GCP stack. It's difficult to even know if I'm building something that's worth value b/c I don't have much insight into things like ruby on rails, python apps, kubernets, containerization. \n\nI just need to understand what it actually takes to get offered the $$$.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've listed out what I'm comfortable discussing in interviews. You tell me, if you will. What am I worth? Right now, I make 60k salary(\\~75k with benefits).
