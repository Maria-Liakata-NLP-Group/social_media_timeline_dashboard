The adaptive self-states are less prominent, driven by a desire for understanding, tolerance, and connection, but are overshadowed by the maladaptive self-states. The maladaptive self-states exhibit rigidity and inflexibility, as they are fixated on specific desires and needs, while the adaptive self-states show some improvement and flexibility, as they are open to exploration and mutual understanding. The maladaptive self-states tend to deteriorate over time, as they are fueled by negative emotions and thoughts, while the adaptive self-states show some improvement, as they are driven by a desire for connection and exploration. The dominance of the maladaptive self-states changes over time, as they are more prominent in some instances and less prominent in others, but they always seem to hinder the fulfillment of basic psychological needs. The changes in aspects such as Affect, Behavior, Cognition, and Desire contribute to these transitions, as they influence the individual's thoughts, feelings, and actions. The maladaptive self-states are more dominant in the instances where the individual is experiencing distress, frustration, and self-doubt, while the adaptive self-states are more prominent in the instances where the individual is seeking connection and exploration.",

The adaptive self-state, driven by a desire for health and well-being, is present but appears to be less influential, with its influence on cognition and behavior being overshadowed by the maladaptive self-state's negative affect and mocking tone.  The maladaptive self-state's dominance is further emphasized by its ability to drive the post's tone and content, suggesting a lack of flexibility and a tendency towards deterioration.  Overall, the interplay between adaptive and maladaptive self-states reveals a complex and dynamic process, with the maladaptive self-state appearing to be more rigid and dominant over time.

As time progresses, the maladaptive self-state remains dominant, with no indication of flexibility or improvement, and its rigidity and persistence hinder the emergence of adaptive self-states.  The maladaptive self-state's dominance over time suggests a lack of adaptive coping mechanisms and a continued reliance on maladaptive strategies, such as self-harm or suicidal ideation, to deal with distress.  The maladaptive self-state's persistence also suggests a lack of cognitive flexibility, as the individual remains stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and feelings, with no apparent shift towards more adaptive cognitions.  Overall, the maladaptive self-state's dominance and persistence indicate a significant deterioration in the individual's psychological well-being and a need for intervention to promote adaptive self-states and improve coping mechanisms.  The maladaptive self-state's rigidity and persistence also suggest a lack of autonomy and relatedness, as the individual is unable to access more adaptive self-states and is instead trapped in a cycle of maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

The maladaptive self-states are driven by intense negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and self-disgust, which influence the individual's behavior and cognition, hindering the fulfillment of basic psychological needs like autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In contrast, the adaptive self-states are driven by positive emotions, such as a desire for connection and relatedness, which support the individual's psychological needs and promote healthy behaviors and thoughts. The individual's self-states are in a state of tension, with maladaptive states dominating their emotions and behaviors in situations of perceived lack of control, but adaptive states providing a sense of purpose and connection in situations of support and connection. The individual's maladaptive self-states are characterized by a sense of rigidity, as they are driven by intense negative emotions and a lack of flexibility in coping with challenging situations, while their adaptive self-states are marked by a sense of improvement, as they emerge in situations of connection and support. The individual's self-states are also marked by a sense of deterioration, as their maladaptive self-states can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, but also by a sense of improvement.",

The maladaptive self-states are characterized by a central organizing aspect of negative emotions, behaviors, and thoughts that hinder psychological needs, and are driven by a Desire/Need for control, autonomy, and relatedness, which is negatively influenced by the individual's Affect, Behavior, and Cognition.

The maladaptive self-state was characterized by a sense of impending doom, driven by the impending lack of medication, which influenced the individual's cognition and behavior, hindering the fulfillment of basic needs such as autonomy and competence.
