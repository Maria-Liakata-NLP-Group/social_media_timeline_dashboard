The doctor wrote a note to the school about my mental illnesses and to give me extension dates for homework but I\u2019m scared the teachers will think it\u2019s an excuse to not do it or something. I\u2019m also scared to see my classmates and be in a place where everyone knows who I am. The thought of walking in the classroom and being in the hallway makes me panic already but actually having to be there makes me even more nervous. Writing it here makes it seem like a small issue. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just scared.",
