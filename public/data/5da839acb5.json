I was taught from a young age that the \u201conly\u201d way to cope with all the hurt is to flip the switch and turn it off - and now all the switches and wires feel flipped and intertwined and I can\u2019t make sense of a single damn thing.  It\u2019s hard to talk to people about the mess of emotions I feel, or the jumbled thoughts I have. I know people care about me, at least some of the time, but not enough for me to feel okay with talking about the things that keep me up at night. It\u2019s a really lonely, isolating feeling to have. But god, I wish anyone cared more than the bare minimum. Enough to reach inside my chest and rip the hurt right from the comfortable place it rests, covered up by all the excuses and lies I use just to make it through each day.  There\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened this year, so much I\u2019ve let people get away with because my heart is just a little too big for blame and anger to hold onto. I\u2019m so drained though, and I\u2019m so sick of making myself feel small in hopes I\u2019ll fit into people\u2019s lives. And I\u2019m scared, because it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. I don\u2019t know if it will.  Writing all of this is pretty pointless, but at least if you tell it to the void, the void can\u2019t talk back and tell you to suck it up or stop complaining.",

        "content": "Feeling like a waste of space. Every time I go to make a post here I get annoyed with myself because honestly, who fucking cares lol. But I'm just drained and need an outlet to vent so here I am yet again.  I know everyone moves through life at different paces, and not everything is as good as it seems, even for people who are more fortunate than others. Even still, I feel like I'm not where I'm meant to be at all and it's slowly killing me. So many people I know are getting their shit together - getting in happy relationships and starting families, having their own homes, and living their best lives. And I know I shouldn't be so worried about that stuff at 23, but fuck. I've been dealt shitty cards from the start and I'm sick of not having anything good for myself. I'm sick of feeling like a shadow in this world.  On top of that, I'm getting increasingly lonely, and usually I can control this feeling and not let it get to me but we all know the role depression plays in making you feel isolated. It's so hard to make friends though. Every time I open up to  someone, or try to build a connection with them, in the end I'm not good enough and they leave. I've stopped reaching out to people because I'm so sick of that cycle repeating. I don't want to keep opening up my heart to people just for them to crush it.  In conclusion, people suck and so does life.",

I try to go to people, try to open up to them, put myself in a vulnerable place and all it ever does is fuck me over and make the hurt of everything that much worse.  I feel sick to my stomach with guilt for feeling this way. My best friend lost someone she loved unexpectedly earlier this year, and I don\u2019t want her to lose another, but it\u2019s all I can feel and think about lately.  I\u2019ve tried to make good changes in my life. I\u2019ve gone to therapy. I went back to school. I tried making friends. I tried dating. In the end, nothing is enough. I\u2019m not enough. There\u2019s always something wrong, either with me or the timing and circumstances.  My heart feels shattered and I feel beside myself with it all. I don\u2019t see the point anymore. I\u2019m never going to have that life I dreamed of. I never asked for much. I just wanted something good to happen. I wanted to be good enough, deserving enough. But I have nothing and no one. Just this ache that won\u2019t go away.",

Today I gave that new song \"If The World Was Ending\" a listen and it shattered me on the spot; it's that easy for me to spiral into missing him, and I hate it.  I hate that I still miss him - not even romantically (okay maybe a little), but overall, his friendship and his presence in my life. It's such a shitty feeling to have the door slammed on you, so to speak. I know that closure is a tricky construct, and that sometimes you have to make it for yourself, but I'm really struggling in that regard. I truly feel like this is something I'll carry with me to my grave, and that eats away at me.  This month has been a real struggle overall. This time last year was the last time we were okay, before things completely broke apart. I broke contact and tried reaching out to him a couple of weeks ago, which was stupid of me and I know that, and he made it pretty clear he has no interest in ever speaking again. I know in the end it's for the best, but right now it's miserable and I wish I could turn back time.",

He was by far the most supportive person in my life for all the months we were together. Not even my best friend comes close to being as sincere and sweet as he was. No one has ever made me feel even a fraction of the way he did.   Any new ideas I had, he encouraged me and gave input. If I was feeling down or sick, he'd stream cartoons for us to watch together until I felt better. He always sent me new songs because he knew I'd be stubborn and play old ones on repeat all day otherwise. He sent the best damn memes and made me laugh more than anyone ever did. And when we called, it was always so comfortable and we'd talk for ages about every little thing. He never complained if I babbled on like an idiot.  This is fucking me up and I can't get past it at all. I don't know what to do. I always just cry it out and then sleep it off, but the cycle repeats and I'm growing weaker. When he left he said I'd find someone like him again, but God, there's only one him and I can never get that back.",

I\u2019m tired of falling apart every night and having to put myself back together every morning. I\u2019m tired of being around people who have better lives than me. I\u2019m tired of being bitter and angry at the world.  I want to die, but I don\u2019t. I want everything to stop, but it isn\u2019t. I want things to change, but they haven\u2019t.

Holidays and family events were always the worst for him, for both of us really. I miss how we\u2019d help each other through it, being the strength for each other that we needed. All I feel now is weak, like a fragile shell of a girl I used to be.  There\u2019s so much I wish I could say to him. Losing the opportunity to spend my life with him is painful, but nothing beats the pain of losing the friendship we had. He was my very best friend and I\u2019ll never get that back, and it kills me every god damn day. I\u2019ll never feel that good or whole again.  I don\u2019t think time is healing anything.",
