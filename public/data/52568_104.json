My english has also gotten so much worse, and it annoys the hell out of me.  I have no idea how I passed last year without attending buy I don't think I can pass this year even if I do manage to go regularly again.  Which means more years of school.  I should probably go a level lower, but that would make my chance to get into college a lot less and I really just want to go.  Plus I get bored so easily when I already know things and I'll start to overthink.  I don't know what to do.",
