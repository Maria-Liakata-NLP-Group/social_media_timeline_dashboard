        "summary": "The individual's mental state is characterized by a mix of maladaptive and adaptive self-states, with the maladaptive self-states being more dominant in some instances, such as the suicidal ideation and the overwhelming negative emotions following the loss of a dog, while the adaptive self-states are less prominent but still present, such as the desire for companionship and love, and the growing sense of self-acceptance and understanding. The maladaptive self-states are driven by negative Affect, such as frustration, anxiety, and despair, which influences the individual's Behavior and Cognition, leading to maladaptive behaviors and thoughts. In contrast, the adaptive self-states are driven by positive Affect, such as love, comfort, and connection, which influences the individual's Behavior and Cognition, leading to adaptive behaviors and thoughts. The individual's Desire/Need for basic psychological needs such as relatedness, autonomy, and competence is hindered in the maladaptive self-states, while it is fulfilled in the adaptive self-states. The individual's mental state is characterized by a mix of maladaptive and adaptive self-states, with the maladaptive self-states being more dominant in some instances, such as the suicidal ideation and the overwhelming negative emotions following the loss of a dog,"
