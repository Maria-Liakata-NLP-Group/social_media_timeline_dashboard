This self-state is characterized by a mix of adaptive and maladaptive aspects, as the individual is weighing the risks and benefits of applying to Costco and considering their own needs and priorities.\n\nOverall, the sequence of self-states reveals a dynamic interplay between adaptive and maladaptive self-states, with the individual experiencing periods of improvement and deterioration. The dominance of the self-states changes over time, with the individual initially struggling with maladaptive self-states but eventually experiencing adaptive self-states. The changes in aspects (Affect, Behavior, Cognition, and Desire) contribute to these transitions, as the individual becomes more aware of their needs and priorities and begins to make changes to improve their well-being."
