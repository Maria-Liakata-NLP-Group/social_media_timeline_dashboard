This desire/need influences the individual's Affect, manifesting as worry and apprehension, and their Cognition, leading to a preoccupation with the potential consequences of the tick bite. The individual's Behavior is also affected, as they seek external validation and reassurance through seeking medical attention and sharing their concerns online. The maladaptive self-state is evident in the individual's focus on the potential risks and their need for immediate reassurance, which may hinder their ability to engage in adaptive coping mechanisms and maintain a balanced perspective. The post suggests the presence of a maladaptive self-state, as the individual's behavior (posting numerous Google reviews) and cognition (perceiving harassment and threats) are driven by a central organizing aspect of negative affect. This negative affect likely influences their behavior, leading them to engage in a repetitive and potentially attention-seeking pattern. Furthermore, their cognition is shaped by this negative affect, causing them to perceive threats and harassment where others might not. This maladaptive self-state hinders the individual's psychological need for relatedness, as their behavior and cognition"
