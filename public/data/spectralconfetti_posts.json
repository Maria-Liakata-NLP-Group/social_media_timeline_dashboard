These feelings go away whenever my confidence diminishes, but I still do not feel that I am trans. The male side of my identity is still a very real thing.\n\nMy question is; is there a label for these feelings? I feel like I go back and forth from feeling masculine and feminine quite regularly.",

        "body": "Has anybody noticed there is a running theme throughout Death Grips' discography of personifying the internet as a woman?\n\n\nIn \"Culture Shock\", Ride is talking about technology and internet culture, while a woman's voice is sampled, and there are vague references to some woman being a \"satanic priestess\"\n\n\n\"This is Violence Now\" also uses a woman's voice to speak the phrase \"You have been banned from the channel\"\n\n\nI realize this is just a couple of examples, but I think it's possible that most if not all lyrics about women are really an esoteric way of talking about the internet's response to Death Grips. This would explain why NOTM (which seemed to say quite a bit about Death Grips' place in the world) is filled with Bj\u00f6rk samples. It's Ride fighting back against the internet's interpretation of who he is, because of course he keeps his real self \"up his sleeves\".\n\n\nWe know that naming their first major album \"The Money Store\" (which is a bank) is an ironic reference to them selling out. But the cover seems to also be a reference if you look at it, because the individual on the leash has fake breasts and Death Grips scratched into the skin. This piece seems to be a statement about Epic trying to reframe DG's image to sell better on the internet. This would of course make the NLDW cover a direct defiance of that and of how the internet percieves them, because a penis represents the opposite of the internet, a woman.\n\n\nI'm not 100% on this, but I thought it'd be fun to write up a theory.",

All proceeds from digital sales will go to RAINN and similar organizations.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aliceglasss/stillbirth\n\n\nThe letter:\n\n\n&gt;Years ago I began the process of trying to remove myself from an abusive relationship that started when I was a teenager. Over the course of that relationship I was systematically cut off from anyone and everyone that I could truly be close to. I was talked down to, yelled at, locked into rooms and criticized daily about my abilities, my weight, my looks, my intelligence and almost every move I made. When I couldn't take it anymore and I wanted to end the relationship I was threatened, then I was told I was loved, and the cycle would begin again. \n\n&gt;I want young women and young men to understand that this kind of treatment of others can happen where it might be least expected. Even in environments that thrive on creativity and open-mindedness, that advocate artistic and counter-culture ideals. Sometimes people will use these things to camouflage themselves so that their abuse might go unnoticed. So that you wouldn't think to consider it could be happening right in front of you.\n\n&gt;The clarity I've gained since getting out of that situation has opened up my life in a way that I didn't imagine was possible. Although some of the pain and anger still lingers, my life finally feels as though it has value and meaning. I speak out now hoping that I can encourage other young women and young men to affirm their value within their relationships or get out. Abuse isn't always obvious and it doesn't have to involve black eyes, blood and broken bones. Emotional and psychological abuse can be just as damaging, and it is extremely difficult to remove yourself from. \n\n&gt;Those that have known me throughout my career might be surprised that someone who publicly gave the impression of being fearless and seemed as though they didn't take shit from anyone could find themselves being severely mistreated and manipulated by someone they were close to. This person nearly stripped me of myself. And for years I felt as though they were waiting for my life to end.\n\n&gt;Stillbirth was written by myself and Jupiter Keyes in our basement. There is no label involved. It will be available through iTunes, Spotify, etc. beginning July 18. All proceeds for digital purchases of this song will benefit organizations (like the nonprofit RAINN) that help survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence and incest. You can donate directly to them at https://donate.rainn.org/ or via the link on my website at http://www.alice-glass.com/ \n\n&gt;There is a sister song to Stillbirth that I hope to release soon, she is a lullaby and she can't wait to meet you",

I'm afraid that an active life will stress me out to the point of desiring suicide, so instead I've committed myself to running out the clock until I'm dead. I'm sick of people who only like me for who they think I am. I've never felt loved for who I really am, by family or anyone. On paper, I had a \"good\" childhood. But my dad is so relentlessly optimistic that it only feels hollow. Why does he say I'm good? Even he must see that isn't true. Every time he acts supportive I know he's masking disappointment.

I'm not posting this seeking participation from anyone else, it's strictly for my own benefit because it feels helpful for me to unload these thoughts in a public space. I may or may not delete it myself depending on how I feel in the future. I just feel like posting it at the moment.\n\n\nWhenever I manage to break from depression, I tend to let myself fall back into old habits almost immediately and my progress is lost. I wanted to take a moment to write up a post I can look back on whenever I forget what got me here. Mostly it's not talking things out, because when I keep all my problems to myself they become overwhelming and I tend to make them seem bigger than they really are. I've noticed every time I've broken from my depression it's been through taking 3 easy steps: 1. Saying what's been on my mind in some sort of way where I know someone else could acknowledge it. 2. Changing my perspective. 3. Not allowing myself to become passive or inactive (this means making my own comfort a priority, and not putting things off unless I actually need to.).\n\n\nOne of the main reasons I let myself fall into my old habits is that I end up convincing myself that no matter what, feeling better is only temporary. Of course, it seems clear to me right now that the best thing I can do is find something productive to do each day to make myself feel better. Binge watching TV, eating junk and sitting on the computer can satiate me temporarily, but that usually leads me back into depression and it becomes a cycle. Maybe the best thing I can do is find something new each day or week, until the majority of my bad habits are replaced by new, better habits. Or maybe I don't have to do that. I don't need to have everything figured out at once. It's just nice to shake things up. That's one of my main problems, always thinking in terms of the future and not living in the moment. It leads to me believing I need to understand everything in absolutes, which encourages me to develop a routine, which causes me to stagnate and fall into depression again. Maybe that's because I just shut down and let myself get absorbed in doing next to nothing for way too long. Accepting things the way they are day in, day out is just not healthy for me.

Emphasis on anything that might involve uncertainty or stress. Pretty much the only time I allow myself to be motivated toward fixing this is at the very end of the day when there's nothing I can do about it. Then I wake up feeling too tired to do anything which allows the cycle to continue. The thought that keeps coming back when I try to figure out how to fix this is that I need to make sure I get out of bed immediately when I wake up rather than start the day by establishing a pattern of putting things off.\n\n\nSo what I've decided to try is writing myself a note reminding myself to get out of bed which I'll be putting on my laptop (the first thing I reach for in the morning). Hopefully this will at least start the day off right, but I'd like to have some more options to keep me going through the rest of the day.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same issue and can offer some strategies?\n\ntl;dr: Big procrastinator, only motivated to change at the end of the day and always unmotivated when I wake up.

        "body": "When the first 4 episodes were released, I had believed the scene between Dale and the Giant was a flash forward. However, I now think this scene takes place simultaneously with Episode 6 and explains why Dale's been acting the way he has for the past 3 episodes.\n\n\nMy belief is that when Dale passed through the electrical socket, his spirit was diverted by the Giant in an effort to spare him should anything happen once he passes through. The Giant could be the one who's been guiding Mr. Jackpots through his journey, helping him win 30 jackpots in the casino in order to call attention to his existence and so on. The Dale that's out living Dougie's life still has traces of the real Dale, but for the most part he's an empty vessel.\n\n\nIn the scene we see at the beginning of Episode 1, the Giant tells Dale what is going on at the present moment in Twin Peaks. He also tells him that he's far away, indicating that not only is he physically far away being in Las Vegas but also that nobody from Twin Peaks has seen him in years. Dale then disappears because this is the moment that the Giant sends him to be woken up in his body.\n\n\nWhat interests me about this is that Dale in that scene seems much wiser about how the Lodge operates given that he simply takes the Giant's information without a hint of confusion. We may see a version of Dale that is now an expert on all the forces at play this season.",

He learned of his fate and swallowed Dougie's wedding ring.\n\n\nThis adds to why Jeffries mentioned Evil Cooper's meeting with Briggs. He suspected Evil Cooper of manufacturing a decoy.",

Everyone wants to know when Dale is going to wake up just like everyone wanted to know who killed Laura. This is why it's taken so long. Their belief seems to be that Dale returning to normal will end the narrative momentum that Season 3 is running on, and I would agree with that.\n\nDale is exceptionally lucky at solving mysteries and bringing disparate elements together. If he were an active player from the start, things would not be developing the way that they have been so far. It would have been too easy and it would've been too similar to how the original was paced and in effect a retread. Given how anti-nostalgia this season has been, it only makes sense. Dale was in some ways an audience insert, someone who existed to make sense of what was going on and guide us through the story. We're not meant to have anyone really solving the mysteries for us. This time around we're Agent Cooper figuring it out for ourselves whether it's through reddit posts or analysis videos on YouTube.\n\nAnother thing tying Laura in the original run to Dale in Season 3 is how in both we see the way each character has impacted the world around them. We saw the good and bad that Laura did, and we see the good that Coop did as well as the bad that Evil Coop has done. \n\nTheory time: [S3E12](/s \"I believe Laura is the key to inevitably waking Dale up. We don't know what she whispered to him in Part 2, but it seems reasonable to think that just as she told him who killed her it's probable that she told him she would have to be the one to wake him up. Because of that, she was removed by the Arm's doppelg\u00e4nger and may have been sent to the same place that Dale was sent to (soon after, Leland tells Dale to 'Find Laura'). She could even be the 'Mother' that the American Girl character (played by the same person who was Ronette in the original run) referred to. Wouldn't be the first time that a Lodge entity claimed familial relation to Laura. In Part 10 she visited Cole, and Margaret told Hawk 'Laura is the one.' This could mean she is the one to bring Dale back. My best guess is that she will appear to Dale alongside the Giant who will return his FBI pin and lead him to the place where we saw him at the start of Part 1.\")",

Not to say it's 100% effective, because he had to send the \":-) ALL\" text and trigger her fear again so that she would send the rest of the coordinates. But her personality in general was different from the actual Diane.\n\n\nWe also see this with Dougie 1.0, who is based on a piece of Dale that Mr. C took when he grabbed him in the Black Lodge. Dale was scared, but he was also lost and confused. This created a tulpa that could never stand up to Mr. C and easily succumbed to vices. His tendency to get confused also likely caused his car accident which Bushnell mentioned in Part 9.\n\n\nFinally, the Dale who gave his hair to Mike in Part 16 was hopeful and optimistic. So the resulting Dougie 2.0 shared those qualities, as exemplified by the cheerful smile on his face.",

Yet here we are 7 months and 24 days after the announcement with no album.\n\nThere's one simple reason for that: Tour dates. They can't really work on the album when they're not in the studio, so any time spent on the road is going to push the album further back.\n\n\nHere's a look at how much studio time DG potentially had for each album:\n\nNLDW\n\nThis one's easy, since they cancelled tour dates to work on the album. They had from late April until the end of September. A little over 4 months.\n\n\n---\n\n\nGovernment Plates\n\nHere they didn't have their first break to work on the album until between June 16th and July 12th, just under a month. Then they had about a week in mid-late July. Then they had only one date between the end of July and late August, so that's about a month. After their last August date they had 2 months and 20 days.\n\nIn total: Roughly 4.3 months\n\n\n---\n\n\nTPTB Disc 1\n\nNo touring during this period, so it's safe to assume they spent pretty much the full 4 months and 20 days working on the album.\n\n\n---\n\n\nJenny Death\n\nNo touring yet again, and they announced the album was complete on October 10th, 2014. Once again it's safe to assume they spent the full 4 months and 2 days working on the album.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBottomless Pit\n\n\nThere were 30 days between the announcement and their set at Day for Night, so that's about 1 month. Then they had 3 months and 25 days between that date and their April 14th show in Santa Cruz.\n\nIn total: 4 months and 24 days\n\n\n---\n\n\nThat leaves us with the new album. I can't be 100% sure when they started on it, but I'll assume it was when they announced it on May 22nd. They had about a week between then and their set at Primavera. After that they were on the road until June 11th. The next show they did was on July 29th, so they had roughly 1 month and 18 days to work on the album. Next they were on the road until August 24th, followed by a gap of 1 month and 20 days. So far it's been 2 months and 4 days since the tour ended.\n\nIn total: *5 months and 20 days*\n\n\n---\n\n\nEvery album so far has taken around 4 months to complete. This means we can be pretty sure the new one is finished as well.\n\nThe final question is, how long will they wait to release the new album?\n\nThat much I can't answer. With Bottomless Pit, they started doing shows 3 weeks before the album came out and they announced the tracklist/cover art 1 month and 18 days before the album came out. It's possible they actually finished BP the week they made that announcement (especially since they also revealed the cover art for TPTB when they announced that album was complete).\n\n\nSo given they usually take around 4 months to make an album and they waited roughly 1 month and 18 days to drop Bottomless Pit, the new album could be out any time in the next few weeks or so. My best guess is mid-to-late February.",

If that\u2019s the case, then the album will most likely be released April 13th. However, there\u2019s also the chance he posted the photos late and they actually finished the album February 6th so it could be an April 6th release. Or it could be released on the earlier side like Bottomless Pit, which would be March 30th.\n\nSo, in the unlikely chance that I\u2019m on to anything here, it could be between March 30th and April 13th.

But Death Grips would continuously deliver material that I just couldn't understand right off the bat. I had to actively think about what their art was doing and look at it from a deeper level in order to fully appreciate it. Now I find it a lot more difficult to just dismiss art or entertainment in general that I don't get at first. I'm much more interested in looking at things from different angles and understanding the broader context that they're created in.\n\nI feel like this feeds into the things they've said about acceleration and being above and beyond a band (hell, think about the words \"VERY SHALLOW LISTENING\" on the BP back cover). They've had such a transformative effect on me, and I feel like I'm not alone in that regard. DG have presented a lot of unconventional art throughout their career, and even within the fan community there's been a great deal of initial bafflement which is followed by a deep understanding and appreciation.\n\nThis is a big reason why I think there's a deep connection between DG and Lynch's art. Both tend to avoid explaining their art in favor of letting the audience put in the effort to draw their own meaning. This approach to art, in my opinion, is far more rewarding than something like what Aronofsky did with his last movie (telling people explicitly what it was about).\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

This changes when I allow myself to cry and release my emotions.\n\nI think this ties into how guarded I am against judgment from others. I'm afraid to be vulnerable, because due to experiences from my childhood I expect criticism for my flaws and that cuts deep. Just yesterday I went to dinner with my family and my brother told my dad that he should get me to stop wearing graphic tees all the time. Now when I was a kid I would internalize a comment like that and feel like there was something wrong with me for wearing graphic tees. These days I'm mature enough to at least recognize that his behavior in that moment wasn't normal or okay. But it's that kind of behavior from him that became a voice in my head after dealing with him throughout my childhood. Him and my dad. I worry about every small problem because I expect judgment like his, and I worry about every big decision because my dad was always concerned with intervening in my future (he made me change schools when I was 14 because my anxiety was causing me to sleep in class and ignore my schoolwork).\n\nSo all of that leaves me feeling frozen and afraid to make decisions for myself. I'm always looking for some external sign of approval that realistically I can't and shouldn't expect. When I can't get approval from others I don't know what to do with myself.",

I had it back on until last night.\n\nThankfully it's 100% intact and my gums didn't even bleed this time. But now I have to deal with not being able to fix the situation until monday at the earliest. I could try getting some dental cement, but it's hard for even professionals to keep this thing on with maximum strength cement. I'd imagine this over-the-counter stuff would probably be about as effective as the cement they used for the temporary crown, and that didn't even last for a day before it came off the first time.\n\nSo with no way of getting reassurance from my dentist, I have to sit here and hope there's no complication from having no crown on this tooth.",

Letting messes pile up around my apartment that I only occasionally clean up (pretty much just the bare minimum) and wasting money ordering out because I'm just too lazy to make my own meals.\n\nThis is all due to me convincing myself that it would just be too hard to fix any of my problems at this point. I just put myself in a smaller and smaller box where I feel less and less capable. It gets to the point where I have trouble thinking of any positive change as a good thing. I'd much rather give myself the temporary comfort of putting off for some other day. The problem is I just end up back at square one when the comfort I've provided myself runs out again. It's a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm breaking that cycle. I'm not looking at it as a negative, or the consequence of poor choices. It's the first steps on the path to who I want to be, because I've waited long enough. I might not get it perfect tomorrow, but I want to start somewhere.",

        "title": "Is it still depression if I don't consciously \"feel\" depressed all the time?",
        "body": "Some context:\n\nI was diagnosed with chronic major depression and generalized anxiety a little over 9 years ago after I had a nervous breakdown and stayed in the hospital long enough to be deemed stable. Before that I also had in-school guidance/therapy sessions in middle school and high school. I've been doing therapy off and on for the past 6-7 years with mixed results. I feel like I can gain some perspective, but at the same time not a lot of progress is made in terms of real life changes.\n\nNow on paper, I think my life sounds like it could be fairly depressing. I live alone, I have 0 friends, my apartment is almost always a mess and I spend most of my time either overthinking and stressing out due to my anxiety, or listening to music and ignoring my problems instead of doing something productive. The irony is that although I seem like an introvert, I actually thrive on socialization if I can actually get myself to talk to people. But I have an avoidant personality disorder as a result of my anxiety and the fact that I grew up with an older brother that constantly insulted and criticized me. So it's hard to feel like I deserve to be around other people. My self-esteem is just way too low.\n\nWhen I think about all of that, it makes me think I probably am depressed.\n\nThe thing is, I've always understood depression to mean that you can't enjoy anything at all. But there are things I do enjoy. I like music, movies, food and occasionally video games. I can still laugh and smile at things and it doesn't feel forced. So how can I call myself depressed if I only occasionally break down in tears?\n\nIt pretty much wasn't until I saw the last Avengers movie and how Thor was depicted and described as depressed that I thought I could accept that I'm usually more depressed than I think I am. Aside from the cause of his depression, I actually found his situation very relatable.\n\nSo I guess what I'm wondering is if it's common to not \"feel\" like you're depressed the way it's usually described/depicted, but still actually be depressed.\n\nCan anyone else relate?",

        "body": "The main problem with BL3\u2019s plot is that there was no reason for us to open the vaults. Lilith claims that it\u2019s \u201cmore complicated\u201d than just fighting the Calypsos directly, but is it really? Nothing about opening the vaults makes taking down the Calypsos any easier. If anything, it just makes them *more* powerful (since Troy and Tyreen get Maya and the Rampager\u2019s powers). Even the device to contain the Destroyer gets us nowhere since Tyreen sabotages it before it could be put to use. After everything we just end up fighting the Calypsos anyway.\n\nContrast this with BL2\u2019s plot:\n\n- We can\u2019t kill Jack right away because we don\u2019t have access to Helios\n\n- Next best thing is getting the vault key back\n\n- Due to bad intel we end up with a power cell that gets Sanctuary\u2019s defenses compromised\n\n- Now we have to go the bunker for the key\n\n- After defeating BNK3R and killing Angel, Jack kills Roland and takes Lilith to the vault to finish charging the key\n\n- We have to find out where the vault is and defeat Jack &amp; the Warrior\n\n\nTechnically we could have found out where the vault was first and just waited for Jack, but the easier option at the beginning of the plot was to follow the intel on the vault key being transported. After that we find out where the vault key is actually located and that becomes the more obvious choice rather than going to the vault and risking the possibility of Jack opening the vault with a fully charged key.\n\nI don\u2019t think this affects BL3\u2019s quality, but it is weird to think how unnecessary the plot ended up being.",

I was given two non-refill prescriptions which I felt no effect from after taking them for two weeks.\n\n\nAfter relying solely on seeing therapists for the past 10 years with minimal progress I\u2019m trying to get myself out of this rut I\u2019ve been in for the past 4 years by trying medication again.\n\n\nThe problem is that I have a real issue with imposter syndrome when it comes to my mental health. I feel guilty even describing myself as suffering from anxiety and depression because I don\u2019t get panic attacks and technically I can get myself out of bed and out of the apartment. I can have conversations. I can interact with people when I have to. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m sad 24/7. I enjoy music, movies/TV and food. It\u2019s more like I just have negative thoughts about myself and I don\u2019t really have strong feelings about much of anything anymore. It\u2019s just easier to not care rather than get my hopes up and be disappointed. I often notice other people be passionate about things and I just can\u2019t relate, aside from maybe with music and movies. But even then people find ways to talk about stuff with so much passion and I just have nothing to say.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s that kind of thing I deal with. Just the comfort of not caring. I do get overwhelmed with sadness on occasion, but usually it\u2019s more like background noise or just a general feeling of negativity that drags me down and keeps me from feeling good enough about myself.\n\n\nBut while I can technically get myself through conversations, I barely ever let myself be an active participant. And I definitely don\u2019t open up. I never feel like the real me when I\u2019m with other people. I\u2019d rather edit myself to the most agreeable version possible. Generally I just feel like my presence is a burden on others.\n\n\nI also of course deal with a lot of second guessing and jumping to conclusions. I overestimate risks and avoid really having a life at all because of it. I\u2019m completely isolated with no friends. And I\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities to change this. I just can\u2019t convince myswlf I\u2019m good enough.\n\n\nBut one of the most frustrating things overall is that I can fully understand what I\u2019m doing wrong and how I should fix it, but the next day I can\u2019t follow through and just end up falling into my usual habits. This is the main problem I\u2019ve been having with therapy. It doesn\u2019t matter what strategies my therapist and I come up with. My dysfunctional brain will just ignore it the next day because I wake up feeling like it\u2019s impossible to start the day. Then once I do start the day I do nothing productive because I feel like I need to do stuff like eat, listen to music and browse the internet as a way to stave off feeling miserable about myself. I mean basically I just spend every day trying to avoid thinking about myself for as long as possible because it always just makes me overwhelmed with sadness again.\n\n\nSo this is why I think I need medication. I have this huge roadblock to progress that no amount of talking or coming up with plans of action will help. It\u2019s not something I can reason with. And doing things like keeping my phone out of the bedroom are only good enough for getting me out of bed.",
